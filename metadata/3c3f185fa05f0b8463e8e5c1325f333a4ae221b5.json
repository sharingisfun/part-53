Complete with high pitched wailing vocals and a mix of doom and blues. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear more than a hint of Sabbath ,I think, when they rock out. But then they stone you out with the coolest electric guitar mantras youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever hear. The vocals might actually put you off, but if you can get past them, or even enjoy them, this is a top notch album, up there with the best Japan had to offer. Note that track 6 might be a bonus track, I am not sure yet, but all references I find to the original release only mention the first 5 tracks. The notes in the cover I have are Japanese! Haha.\nEnjoy!\nBrainticket.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c3f185fa05f0b8463e8e5c1325f333a4ae221b5","amp;dn":"Flower+Travellin%5C%27+Band+-+Satori+%28Heavy+Eastern+PsychRock%2C+Japan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c3f185fa05f0b8463e8e5c1325f333a4ae221b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,63,24,95,160,95,11,132,99,232,229,193,50,95,51,58,74,226,33,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
