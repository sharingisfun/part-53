In this film, 'law' intervenes in the love of the characters in a diverse manner. 'Law' brought the two characters together yet it is endlessly driving the woman towards death with its threatening blade. Ironically, the only way lawyer, SUH Jun-ha, can save this woman's life is through 'judgement by the law.' Such a well-woven relationship between 'law' and 'love' throughout the film is the strength that keeps the film from losing its tension to the end. Also, &quot;Indian Summer&quot; tells that it is 'love' that leaps over 'law.' 'A decision of law' is always made through logical judgement but 'love' cannot be chosen, it is something out of your hands. However, there are times when 'love' is closer to truth. &quot;Indian Summer&quot; is about such 'love.' &lt;P&gt;\n\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293280&quot;&gt;Imdb rating 7.2/22 votes&lt;/A&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n\n\nEng sub included&lt;p&gt;\n\nFile     :  688 MB (688 MB),  duration: 1:45:35,  type: AVI,  1 audio stream \nVideo :  582 MB,  771 Kbps,  23.976 fps,  512*384 (4:3),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4\nAudio :  106 MB,  141 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  2 channels,  0x55 = MPEG Layer-3&lt;p&gt;\n\n************************************************************&lt;p&gt; \nHey!
