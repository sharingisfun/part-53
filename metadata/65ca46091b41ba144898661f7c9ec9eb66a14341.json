Obviously the most well-known song off this album is &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;, but there's a lot of other good material here as well, including the upbeat &quot;Room Service&quot;, the groove-heavy &quot;C'mon and Love Me&quot;, and the sensual &quot;She&quot;. Though Kiss would not become superstars until their next album (that would be Destroyer), Dressed to Kill shows them headed in the right direction, having hit on the elusive formula of heavy chords, strong rhythms, and a determination not to take themselves too seriously. --Genevieve Williams\n\n1.
