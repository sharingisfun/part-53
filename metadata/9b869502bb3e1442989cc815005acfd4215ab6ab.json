While the series never aired, the pilot episode has been repackaged as the two-hour movie HOMELAND SECURITY, which opens with a timeline of the bungled clues and warnings that preceded 9/11. After the attacks, the fictional character--and Tom Ridge stand-in--Admiral Theodore McKee (PICKET FENCES' Tom Skerritt) is called upon to create a new department that will coordinate information from the FBI, CIA, various branches of the military, and law enforcement agencies to prevent any such further terrorist acts in America. Leland Orser (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), Grant Show, (MELROSE PLACE), Scott Glenn (TRAINING DAY), and Kal Penn (HAROLD &amp; KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE) costar in this ripped-from-the-headlines telefilm that plays out like a real-life version of the Fox series 24.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b869502bb3e1442989cc815005acfd4215ab6ab","amp;dn":"Homeland+Security+Dvd-r+Movie%2BMenu+Spa-Eng+WS+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b869502bb3e1442989cc815005acfd4215ab6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,134,149,2,187,62,20,66,152,156,200,21,0,90,207,212,33,90,182,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
