And as a bonus, they sound pretty good too. It took seven years until NOPLACETOHIDE attempted a new album and with &quot;Zukunft&quot; they created a continuation to their debut &quot;Vergangenheit&quot;, released in 1995. The long break was due to some line-up changes and so they were ready to do a new effort in 2001.\n\nThis album convinces up from the start but it also shows that the time doesn't stand still and the sound of the Norwegians has changed a bit. They are more noisy and sick and it's not uncommonly that one will have bands like NEUROSIS, BREACH or WILL HAVEN in his mind when he listen to this sound. They kept up the progressiveness of the first release, but their thrashy influences disappeared partly or you can hear them only in the background.\n\nDefinately worth listening to.
