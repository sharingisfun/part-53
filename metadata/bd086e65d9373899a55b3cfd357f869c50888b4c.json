In total their release is 111 minutes long,\n          so there are 28 minutes of &quot;bonus&quot; scenes. Check our sample folder\n          for one such a repeated scene, 4400-scene1.crimson.avi starts at 49.19, \n          4400-scene2.crimson.avi starts at 1.15.07.\n          There are also segments that are out of sync and\n          some segments have been encoded with a bitrate of around 150 KB/s.\n\n          We would like to thank Crimson for providing the perfect example why\n          segmenting needs to be banned. This is one of the worst releases i have \n          ever seen. We have cut one of the repeat scenes from their release to show\n          what these groups try to get away with: 4400-scene1.crimson.avi and\n          4400-scene2.crimson.avi are both from their release, they both show the same\n          scene, however -scene1 has a bitrate of 726 Kb/s while -scene2 only has\n          158 Kb/s. How can this be since both scenes are identical? Seems they\n          had to encode one segment &quot;a bit lower&quot; to fit and the result is we get\n          COMPLETE AND UTTER CRAP. How can you even think of releasing a TV show\n          with a bitrate of 158 Kb/s ? You can if all you care about is releasing\n          before anyone else and don&amp;#039;t give a shit about quality at all.\n\n          BAN SEGMENTING.\n\n          And for those who think our release is undersized:\n\n          This is a DSR and as we know The 4400 is usually dark.\n          Undersized is not a flaw in this case. It is undersized because the file\n          is perfectly saturated.\n          For those who care, here are the Frame Quality Statistics:\n\n          DRF=1&amp;2:         77544 65.3%\n          DRF=3:  0 0.0%\n          DRF=4:  41233 34.7%\n          DRF=5:  0 0.0%\n          DRF=6:  0 0.0%\n          DRF=7:  0 0.0%\n          DRF=8:  0 0.0%\n          DRF=9:  0 0.0%\n          DRF&gt;9:  0 0.0%\n          KeyF/DeltaF:  1.21%\n          KeyDRF&lt;4: 1442\n          KeyDRF=4: 0\n          KeyDRF&gt;4: 0\n\n          AverageKeyDRF: 2.00\n          MAXDRF: 4\n          AverageDRF: 2.68\n          Deviation: 0.95\n\n          Since the source resolution is only 544, there isn&amp;#039;t much sense in upping the resolution.\n          We increased the audio bitrate to 160kbps, but we refuse to use quant1 just to fill up to\n          the standard size.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd086e65d9373899a55b3cfd357f869c50888b4c","amp;dn":"The.4400.S03E01.E02.The.New.World.DSR.XviD-SAiNTS.%5BVTV%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd086e65d9373899a55b3cfd357f869c50888b4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,8,110,101,217,55,56,153,165,91,60,253,53,127,134,156,80,136,139,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
