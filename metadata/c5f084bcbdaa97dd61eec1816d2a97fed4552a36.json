If so, your current\npatching approach might be inadequate. Too many patches to track,\nunexpected behavior, unreliable scripts and complex reporting schemes are   \n\nreplaced by a simple, reliable and comprehensive approach to patch \ndeployment management.   \n\nSoftware patches add risk to maintaining uptime but are required for \nsecuring your business. IT administrators live with this contradiction\nevery day. How do you mitigate the risks to uptime imposed by patching\nwhile securing your systems? There is only one solution: find a way to\nreliably deploy patches that minimizes the threat to uptime. \n\nDesigned for the IT administrator, UpdateEXPERT automates the process of    \nresearching patch histories and co-dependencies. Deployment scripting is \nunnecessary, and you do not need to know where patches are applicable.      \nUpdateEXPERT uses St. Bernard Software's independent patch management       \nmetadatabase.  \n\nMore info can be found @  \n\nhttp://www.stbernard.com/products/updateexpert/products_updateexpert.asp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5f084bcbdaa97dd61eec1816d2a97fed4552a36","amp;dn":"UpdateExpert+V6.3+SUB100-BiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5f084bcbdaa97dd61eec1816d2a97fed4552a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,240,132,188,189,170,151,221,97,238,193,129,109,42,151,254,212,85,42,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
