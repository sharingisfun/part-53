A gutsy opus of dance-oriented pop, DANGEROUS spawned an ambitious world tour that broke previous attendance records and took Jackson to the newly democratized cities of Eastern-bloc Europe. This highly rated HBO special captures Jackson on the DANGEROUS tour with a complete concert recorded in Bucharest, Romania, on October 1, 1992, blazing through an energetic set that includes dazzling live performances of album hits like &quot;Heal the World&quot; and &quot;Black or White&quot; as well as older classics &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; &quot;Beat It,&quot; &quot;Man in the Mirror,&quot; and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80045a50932d6baea1c717c0841283116817842","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+live+in+Bucharest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80045a50932d6baea1c717c0841283116817842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,0,69,165,9,50,214,186,234,28,113,124,8,65,40,49,22,129,120,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
