This time a lot more mellow, of course with a\nfew exceptions (Weather report). A very beutiful album which ranges\nfrom lovely ballads to country, blues and hard-rock. \nThis is a CD-rip, but it must be a bootleg-CD. Probably somebody\nwho have made a vinyl-rip...\nHowever, the sound is OK but it's not excellent.\nI put a bonus track on this myself. The last song &amp;quot;Steamhouse&amp;quot;. I've\nripped this myself from a vinyl single released in 1972.  The B-side is a \nsong from this LP.\nThey have a different drummer than on the first LP. Ken Gudman who\nis probably quite well-known in Denmark.\n\nTracks:\n1 Julia\n2 Keyboard waltz\n3 Classified adds\n4 Late night woman blues\n5 Mind pollution/Weather report\n6 Autumn of it all\n7 Satisfied mind\n8 Steamhouse (Bonus)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36bb805ea6824c6e7e1681c1dcda24e947717c63","amp;dn":"Culpeper%5C%27s+Orchard+-+Second+sight+1972+%28Excellent+Danish+progre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36bb805ea6824c6e7e1681c1dcda24e947717c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,187,128,94,166,130,76,110,126,22,129,193,220,218,36,233,71,113,124,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
