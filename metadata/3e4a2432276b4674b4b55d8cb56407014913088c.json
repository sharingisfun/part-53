[BTW, we recommend that a certain \n    FLT person takes a closer look at the cgamex86.dll on his beta cd.]\n    \n    Lately we have seen a number of newbies and dumb biased scene nukers asking\n    why DEViANCE even bother to release finals for games that have been \n    released as late betas by other groups. We couldn't say it better than our\n    competition themselves have done, as quoted from an nfo for a game that \n    FLT put the US-store final out for (Final Fantasy 8):\n        \n    &quot;So here you have the full FINAL version of this Huge game and Error free \n     Bins, Killing two birds with One Stone. The purpose of the ISO scene is \n     to share images of store final CDS, the same product that would be sold \n     as retail in a software shop. Otherwise we risk problems of update patches \n     not working correctly.&quot;\n     \n    We would welcome if all groups aimed to uphold quality in the iso-releasing \n    scene - and that means that groups do not release betas intentionally and \n    that they do not release versions of games of which they are not sure if \n    they are really final. Mistakes in judging what is final and what is beta \n    can of course happen and have happened to us in the past as well.\n\n    But we in DEViANCE believe that it is not acceptable when iso-groups like \n    FLT release betas in almost regular short intervals. We can only hope that \n    our competition in FLT will finally learn that reviewers' copies on gold \n    cdrs are almost never the final versions of a game - and definitely not \n    worthwhile iso releases.\n    \n    If you prefer betas, do not leech this release.\n  \n  \n    Game Notes:\n    \n    Set during the most trying years of the war, from 1942 to 1945, Medal\n    of Honor: Allied Assault gives you a sense of the courage it took to\n    survive the landings at Normandy, the assault at Arzew, a rendezvous\n    with the French Resistance outside the village of St. Lo and the push\n    through the heavily defended border of Germany itself to take the\n    bridge at Remagen. You assume the role of Lt. Mike Powell, member of\n    the famed 1st Ranger Battalion, who gets recruited by the OSS and\n    battles through over 20 levels based on historical military campaigns\n    of World War II.\n\n    Game Features:\n   \n    Over 20 levels - accomplish specific objectives and goals in order to\n    succeed and advance.\n    \n    Fully realized 3D worlds utilizing the powerful Quake III engine.\n    \n    Over 1000 unique character animations for an unsurpassed level of\n    realism.\n    \n    Multiple online options including team combat and traditional last man\n    standing modes.\n    \n    Encounters with 22 different enemies including Wehrmacht Snipers,\n    Kradschuetzen Motorcycle Troops and Gestapo Officers.\n    \n    Access to over 21 historically accurate World War II era weapons,\n    including Thompson submachine guns, Mark II Frag Grenades, .50 cal\n    mounted machine guns, flame-throwers and &quot;sticky bombs &quot;.\n    \n    Four different stationary weapons the player can use against the\n    enemy.\n    \n    More than 18 enemy vehicles including the Tiger Mark I Heavy Tank,\n    Stuka Dive Bombers, and V2 Rockets.\n    \n    Weather and time-of-day effects.\n    \n    Assault enemy units alone and as part of a crack military squad.\n    \n    Special 'disguise 'mode that allows players to put on enemy uniforms\n    to evade capture.\n    \n    Highly destructible interactive environments.\n    \n    Original orchestral score by Medal of Honor composer Michael\n    Giacchino.\n    \n    Sound effects by the award winning Medal of Honor sound design team at\n    EALA.\n\n    \n    Install Notes:\n    \n    1) Unrar.\n    2) Burn the .iso:s files with CDRWin or Fireburner.\n    3) Install the game. Use one serial from /serials-dir.\n    4) And then play :)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4a2432276b4674b4b55d8cb56407014913088c","amp;dn":"Medal.of.Honor.Allied.Assault-KRiG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4a2432276b4674b4b55d8cb56407014913088c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,74,36,50,39,107,70,116,180,181,93,140,181,100,7,1,73,19,8,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
