See the\n    following &quot;New Features&quot; and &quot;Changed Features&quot;\n    for more information.\n\n    The &quot;i&quot; has been added to represent that McAfee\n    VirusScan Enterprise is the first anti-virus\n    product in the world that contains proactive\n    Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) protection\n    capabilities. These IPS capabilities are\n    provided in the Buffer Overflow Protection\n    feature which comes from McAfee Entercept, our\n    host intrusion prevention security product.\n\n-   Access Protection.\n\n    Use this feature to prevent intrusions by\n    restricting access to ports, files, shares, and\n    folders.\n\n    You can block ports by creating rules to specify\n    which ports to block and whether to restrict\n    access to inbound or outbound processes. You can\n    also exclude processes from the rule if you want\n    a specific process, or list of processes, to be\n    allowed access to the otherwise blocked port.\n    When you block a port, both TCP and UDP accesses\n    are blocked.\n\n    You can restrict access to shares by making them\n    read-only or blocking read and write access to\n    all shares.\n\n    You can block files and folders by creating\n    rules that specify which processes to block from\n    the files or folders you define, which file\n    actions to prevent, and what action to take when\n    an attempt is made to access a blocked item.\n\n    These Access Protection features can be very\n    effective in preventing intrusions. In the event\n    of an outbreak, the administrator can block\n    access to the infected areas until a DAT is\n    released.\n\n       NOTE:\n       If you block a port that is used by the\n       ePolicy Orchestrator agent or the Entercept\n       agent, the agent&amp;#039;s processes are trusted by\n       the filter and are allowed to communicate\n       with the blocked port. All other traffic not\n       related to these agent processes will be\n       blocked.\n\n    This version of VirusScan Enterprise provides\n    some sample port blocking rules and some sample\n    file and folder blocking rules. With a default\n    installation, some of these rules are in warning\n    mode and others are in blocking mode.\nJust install and UPDATE ... and use\n                                    best regards  alexG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da83a4e55f4e41877d5edf01fcca346265ef91b","amp;dn":"MCAFEE+VIRUSSCAN++ent+ed+8.0i.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da83a4e55f4e41877d5edf01fcca346265ef91b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,168,58,78,85,244,228,24,119,213,237,240,31,204,163,70,38,94,249,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
