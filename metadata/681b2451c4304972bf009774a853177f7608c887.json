All you have to do is decide how big you want the output file to be Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the program then automatically calculates the right settings for producing the best quality at that file size. \n\nThe special highlights:\n\n1.Convert and compress your existing movie files into a selection of formats that can be played on PDAs and/or Handhelds! \nFormats for home DVD players are also available!\n \n2.Burn your movie files to CDs (supports Video CDs, Super Video CDs, DivX/Xvid CDs and normal file CDs)! \n\n3.Let the program automatically split your movies to multiple CDs if  they are too big!\n \n4.Supports XVid/DivX AVIs, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, QuickTime, WMV, Video CDs, Super Video CDs, DivX/Xvid CDs!\n \n5.Convert/shrink unencrypted VOB files into smaller high-quality\nformats!\n\nP.S If any of my torrents is out of seeders,start download anyway so i can see it,then i start to seed again =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681b2451c4304972bf009774a853177f7608c887","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Movie+Shrink+%26+Burn+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681b2451c4304972bf009774a853177f7608c887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,27,36,81,196,48,73,114,191,0,151,116,168,83,23,127,118,8,200,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
