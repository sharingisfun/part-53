The weapon is lowered when you jump in the same way when you sprint. It has nothing to do with being in the air or not, you CAN fire when parachute.\n\n*You can NOT throw C4 when jumping. You can jump and throw grenades but you can not throw medic or ammopacks.\n\n*The grenadelauncher have been significant worse. You can not jump and fire with it and the splash have been weakend. The grenades now bounces on walls but it does explode at a direct hit.\n\n\n*AA is much more efficient against helicopter. 2 IGLA for one attack-heli. Heli-pilots will find it much harder staying alive and have to learn to evade using flares and take out AAÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¦s fast. AAÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¦ still hit friendly planes.\n\n*UAV is now a flying airplane that circels the area. All weapons can harm the UAV but most efficient is the Jeep MG that only took about 5 seconds to kill the UAV. The COMM will have to learn to place the UAV right so it cant be fired at to easy. AT probably will be able to kill the UAV with a lot of practising.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d8fc1a694fc5d914306ddd985c64c013db72a0","amp;dn":"BF2+patch+test+1.2+alpha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d8fc1a694fc5d914306ddd985c64c013db72a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,216,252,26,105,79,197,217,20,48,109,221,152,92,100,192,19,219,114,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
