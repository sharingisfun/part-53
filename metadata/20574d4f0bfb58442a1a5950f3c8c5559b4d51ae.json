Indeed, beautiful in its loneliness, vast in its\nhopelessness, the album - a significant step in Lacrimosa's history.\n\nWhere Angst, Tilo Wolff's 1991 debut, was a barren and minimalist foray\ninto mostly one dimensional, darkwave synth &quot;rock,&quot; (and I use the term\nvery loosely) Einsamkeit brings to the table a much-needed flair for\ndrama and theatricality - two aspects Lacrimosa would forthwith nurture\nand cultivate.\n\nThe songs are generally lengthy and weighty affairs; isolated vistas of\nmorose, forlorn vocals, drawn out keyboards, sparse guitars, cellos,\nviolins, accordions. Very intimate and focused in on their common theme\nof &quot;einsamkeit,&quot; but also quite towering and epic in their tragic\ngrandeur.\n\nThis is still a band (or more correctly, an individual) just starting to\nbecome aware of the scope and magnitude of their vision, of what the\nmusic may grow into sometime down the line; there are still the\noccasional flaws and rookie stumbles. Einsamkeit is still an immensely\nsatisfying piece of work, transcending the mundane gloom &amp; doom gothic\nclichs with its rich, vivid, poetic display of unbound emotion and soul.\nMore so, it's a harbinger of things to come, and when seen in the scope\nof Lacrimosa's entire body of work, a truly mesmerizing harbinger it is\nindeed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFlac-format, if not supported download\nhttp://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=131643\n\nEnjoy!\n/Hybr1d","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20574d4f0bfb58442a1a5950f3c8c5559b4d51ae","amp;dn":"Lacrimosa+-+Einsamkeit+%281992%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20574d4f0bfb58442a1a5950f3c8c5559b4d51ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,87,77,79,11,251,88,68,42,26,89,80,243,200,197,85,155,77,81,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
