But what price are we paying for the homogenised, cheap and convenient food that supermarkets specialise in? In a two-part programme, journalist Jane Moore investigates how supermarkets have affected the food on our plates and reveals the tell-tale signs that the food we buy may not have been grown in the way we think.\n\nUsing a combination of undercover filming and scientific analysis, Supermarket Secrets investigates whether the food on supermarket shelves is really as good as it looks, whether prices are as good as they seem and what happens behind the scenes in the production of supermarket food.\n\nThis year Britain's shoppers are expected to spend around &amp;pound;70billion on food. 56% of this total expenditure will take place in supermarkets. These films ask how supermarkets manage to push prices down and profits up. Are farmers and growers being pressured to produce food in a manner that leads to it being less nutritious than in the past? And what of the conditions that livestock is reared in today?\n\nRuntime......: 01:37:58\nVideo Codec..: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate: 400 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 64 kb/s\nFrame Size...: 352x240","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f216d0a8e664e93a56ae4da6e7eb4d8325d72043","amp;dn":"Supermarket+Secrets+%28The+Crap+you+buy+and+eat+every+Day%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f216d0a8e664e93a56ae4da6e7eb4d8325d72043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,22,208,168,230,100,233,58,86,174,77,166,231,235,77,131,37,215,32,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
