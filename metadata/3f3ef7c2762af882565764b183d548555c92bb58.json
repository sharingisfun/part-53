And Ted O'Keefe and Mark Weber were scheduled for a live in-studio debate with Aaron Breitbart, senior researcher from the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center. Breitbart chickened out at the last minute, so for over 2 hours from 7:30 PM until 10:00 PM, on the evening of December 17, 1990, roughly a million KFI listeners from as far away as Oregon and Texas got an unforgettable dose of history in accord with the facts. This is probably the most effective case for Holocaust revisionism ever carried over the airwaves.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3ef7c2762af882565764b183d548555c92bb58","amp;dn":"Holocaust+Revisionism+on+KFI+AM+640+%281990%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3ef7c2762af882565764b183d548555c92bb58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,62,247,194,118,42,248,130,86,87,100,177,131,213,72,85,92,146,187,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
