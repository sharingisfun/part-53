From what we wear to the food we eat and our methods of travel - it&amp;#039;s all been invented or significantly altered by inventions.\n\nBut sometimes an invention comes along that doesn&amp;#039;t just change the way we do things but changes the world.\n\nInventions That Changed The World examines not only how and why life altering inventions got off the ground in the first place, but also how they created a domino effect spawning other essential inventions in their wake.\n\nBeginning with the gun, Jeremy reveals that successful attempts to create ever more lethal weapons have not only shaped the world but led directly or indirectly to all of the following: the industrial revolution; the production line; cowboy films; street lighting; the car exhaust pipe and the development of trauma medicine.\n\nOther inventions covered in the series include:\n\n? the computer, without which we couldn&amp;#039;t fly planes, drive cars or even run our dishwashers;\n? the jet which plays a key part in our weather, mass tourism and outbreaks like SARS;\n? the telephone which was invented by mistake by a man trying to make a humming telegraph. The telephone has not only changed the way we do business but also led to the development of the internet;\n? the television which was invented by two men with wildly different visions: John Logie Baird, a Scotsman, and a 14-year old American Mormon, Philo T Farnsworth, both died unrewarded but their invention, Jeremy reveals, helped win the Battle of Britain.\n\nThroughout the series Jeremy Clarkson (also host of Top Gear UK) gives his own passionate and witty take on some of the inventions and inventors that he believes have helped change the course of history.\n\nMore info: http://imdb.com/title/tt0417334/\n\nMPG File Details\n===================================================================================\nName.........: Inventions That Changed The World (2004) THE GUN (56m09s) ConRes.mpg\nFilesize.....: 566 MB (or 580,428 KB or 594,358,352 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:56:09\nVideo Codec..: None (MPEG)\nVideo Bitrate: ?\nAudio Codec..: None (MPEG)\nAudio Bitrate: ?\nFrame Size...: 352 x 288 (1.3:1)\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nEnjoy.. :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffb1216d838366200d49903690233d14306bcef","amp;dn":"Inventions+That+Changed+The+World+%282004%29+THE+GUN+%2856m09s%29.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffb1216d838366200d49903690233d14306bcef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,251,18,22,216,56,54,98,0,212,153,3,105,2,51,209,67,6,188,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
