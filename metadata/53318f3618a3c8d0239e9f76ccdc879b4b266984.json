Comments &amp; Suggestions are always welcome !!\n\n    Releases will be made available on a weekly basis, unless a serious bug\n    is found, or something else important happens that justifies an Update.\n\n    ALWAYS REMEMBER:\n\n    This is software in development - You should regard yourself as a BetaTester!\n    Please read the complete Changelogs to keep yourself informed.\n    Some features might still be in their initial development stages ...\n\n    You can find some Troubleshooting Tips further down this document.\n    Please read this .nfo - it has some useful information, really ;-)\n\n    Keep a tried and trusted XBMC Version handy, incase you need to go back !\n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n    SKINS INCLUDED:\n\n    Original Project Mayhem III skin from CVS only.\n    It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small &amp; Clean.\n    This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,\n    make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.\n    Don&amp;acute;t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - You&amp;acute;re on your own here !\n\n    The only thing that&amp;acute;s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.\n    I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface\n    from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice &amp;acute;coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.\n    This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.\n\n    You can get more Skins here:\n    http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7\n    http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&amp;cat=0\n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n\n    SCRIPTS INCLUDED:\n\n    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / StupidVideos\n    QuickTimeBrowser [fixed] (Movie Trailers) / WebRadio (simpleKML V2)\n    XBMCLyrics / XBMCScripts\n\n    All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style.\n\n    I modified the \\Skin\\Project Mayhem III\\PAL\\DialogSubMenu.xml so that all\n    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don&amp;acute;t like this, or\n    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.\n    The original file from CVS has been renamed to DialogSubMenu.xml.CVS\n\n    Get more Scripts @ http://www.xbmcscripts.com or via the XBMCScripts menu.  \n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n\n    VISUALISATION ADDONS INCLUDED (All Zipped):\n\n    G-Force:  1507 total (including the 490 CVS supplied ones)\n    Milkdrop: 10810 total (including the 436 CVS supplied ones from WinAmp 5.1)\n              \n    The Original G-Force CVS Presets are backed up to the folder\n    \\visualisations\\G-Force\\Original Files from CVS\\\n    \n    I slightly modified some settings in \\visualisations\\milkdrop.xml\n    The Milkdrop Addon Pack with 10810 Presets is the default setting.\n    The original file from CVS has been renamed to milkdrop.xml.CVS\n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n    RELEASE NOTES:\n\n    Had to realize that a Computer without Internet is quite a boring experience.\n    Internet Line was broken, so no Release was possible :-(\n   \n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n    CHANGELOG:\n\n    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can\n    see what&amp;acute;s included here. Always read the official XBMC Changelog at  \n    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup\n    You can also find it in \\docs\\Changelog.txt\n\n    10-12-2005 fixed: IMDB &quot;Movie Lookup&quot; on folders\n    09-12-2005 fixed: rarmanager errors preventing cvs from compiling\n                      (just commented out the offending lines)\n    09-12-2005 fixed: ReplayGain wasn't correctly using the settings in the GUI.\n\n.:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n    TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:\n\n    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version\n    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC&amp;acute;s &quot;SaveGame&quot;\n    using the Micro$oft Dashboard.\n    Alternatively, just delete the E:\\TDATA\\0face008 and E:\\UDATA\\0face008 dirs.\n    This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.\n\n    To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - \n    if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.\n    You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.\n\n    If using XBMC as Dashboard, don&amp;acute;t forget to update the files on DRIVE &amp;acute;C&amp;acute;.\n\n\n    IMPORTANT UNPACKING INFORMATION:\n\n    If (after unpacking) you think this Release is missing files READ THIS !\n    This is a Multi-Volume RAR Archive [Compressed with WinRAR 3.50]\n    To unpack it you need to have all files in the same folder and start\n    extraction from the first volume. Please use an UP-TO-DATE WinRAR or any\n    other Program that correctly handles Multi-Volume RAR Archives.\n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n    THANKS:\n\n    All the XBMC developers !!\n    Your program makes the XBOX worth soOo much more for all of us !\n    Everyone contributing to the scene !\n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^                                                                            ^\n    PS:\n\n    Enjoy &amp; Please Seeeeed !\n\n .:............................................................................:.\n  :                                                                            :\n  :For Budget Reasons the Light at the End of the Tunnel had to be switched Off:\n  :                                                                            :\n .:............................................................................:.\n  ^GasGiver                       &amp;deg;02.10.2005&amp;deg;                         GasGiver^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53318f3618a3c8d0239e9f76ccdc879b4b266984","amp;dn":"10.12.2005.XBMC.XBOX.MediaCenter.1.1.0.GasGiver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53318f3618a3c8d0239e9f76ccdc879b4b266984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,49,143,54,24,163,200,208,35,158,159,118,204,220,135,155,75,38,105,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
