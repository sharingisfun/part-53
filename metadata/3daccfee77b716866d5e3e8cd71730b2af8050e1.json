The purpose of this utility is to give you access to all the undocumented features of Detonator and Catalyst drivers. Drivers have a lot of undocumented registry entries. Some of them don?t affect anything, but there are some that are very useful. In general, they cannot give you big performance boost but they can improve image quality and solve some compatibility problems. RivaTuner will help you to change all undocumented registry entries. It supports all versions of Detonators (now called ForceWare) drivers starting from Detonator 2.08 under Windows 98 / Windows 98 SE / Windows ME (Detonator 5.08 or higher under Windows 2000 / Windows XP).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3daccfee77b716866d5e3e8cd71730b2af8050e1","amp;dn":"RiveTuner+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3daccfee77b716866d5e3e8cd71730b2af8050e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,172,207,238,119,183,22,134,109,94,62,140,215,23,48,178,175,128,80,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
