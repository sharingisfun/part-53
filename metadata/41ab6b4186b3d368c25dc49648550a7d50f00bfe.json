He goes deep into the origens of Communism and the Marxist ideology. The Secular Humanists and the trashing of the Judaeo/Christian tradition underpinning law, politics and the social fabric.\n\nHe does spend some time detailing Australia&amp;#039;s plunge into the Globalist trap but it is relevant to all people.\n\nAfter the main lecture there are more that follow including interesting interviews with an Australian reporter.\n\nIf you wish to understand the origens of the New World Order ideolouges then I urge you to download and distribute this DVD lecture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ab6b4186b3d368c25dc49648550a7d50f00bfe","amp;dn":"%5BDocumentary%5DNWO+-+Seduction+Or+Soloution_communism_UN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ab6b4186b3d368c25dc49648550a7d50f00bfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,171,107,65,134,179,211,104,194,93,196,150,72,85,10,125,80,240,11,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
