At least \nthat's my opinion, so after what seemed like an eternity of encoding error \nhells, and unplayable DVDs I finally located a decent, *not perfect* but good, \ncopy of the film and now pass it on to you.\n\nSnowbloodApple review: http://www.mandiapple.com/snowblood/gawi.htm\n\nProps to ASIANTORRENTS kidz and to Scott at http://www.foutz.net !\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9251efa1094afae2cbca072c50802db278485e4","amp;dn":"Gawi+%28aka+Nightmare%29+Korean+Horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9251efa1094afae2cbca072c50802db278485e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,37,30,250,16,148,175,174,44,188,160,114,197,8,2,219,39,132,133,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
