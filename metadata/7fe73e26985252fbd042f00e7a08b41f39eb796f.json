Concert at 4625 kbps and extras at 1847 kbps. There is a sample vob included if you want to check the video quality.\n\nI used Procoder as I prefer it over CCE with interlaced material.\n\nDD2.0-audio removed. Menus untouched. Cover included.\n\nYou may find that the concert is a bit grainy. That is intentional as the original film was shot on Super 16mm :)\n\nI have a slow connection so have patience when downloading. And do seed when your done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe73e26985252fbd042f00e7a08b41f39eb796f","amp;dn":"Kansas+-+Device+Voice+Drum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe73e26985252fbd042f00e7a08b41f39eb796f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,231,62,38,152,82,82,251,208,66,240,14,122,8,180,31,57,235,121,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
