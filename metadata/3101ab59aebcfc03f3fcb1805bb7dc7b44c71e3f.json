Top view, colourful graphics, cute atmospheric music, one hero (you) tries to save the world and it involves a lot of action.\n\nAlso, this is someone elses work. My original CD is way to damaged to even think of putting it to the computer.\n\nPCSXBOX configurations:\nDarn I can't remember. On the PSX years ago I managed through the game but when I tried it again on the xbox I couldn't even get of the ship at the beginning. So I quickly gave it up. You just need the img file to play and have this in mind if it doesn't work.\n\n* Turn off all graphic filterings.\n* Set throttering to no keys.\n* Try with BIOS.\n* Turn of auto load last save state.\n* Check this link http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=238506 to see how others did.\n\n\nOther games that I have and all works on the Xbox.

Sometimes it's even better than playing on a\nreal Playstation. That is if you got the game to actually\nwork, which seems to be a difficult task. Because of that\nfew will choose to play PSX on the Xbox and a game will be\nhard to find, as it already is. The Xbox community is big\nand by introducing the PSX there a dying race might rise\nagain, or at least not be forgotten. And others, both old\nand new, will have a chance to enjoy what once ruled the\nearth. Please help this community by putting this entire\ntag in your torrent description along with details of\nPcsxbox configuration for the game. By having this tag a\ngame will surely work on the Xbox when making a search on\nPCSXBOX. While making a simple search on PSX others can\nenjoy it on other systems as well.\n\n/Thanks for sharing.\n----------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3101ab59aebcfc03f3fcb1805bb7dc7b44c71e3f","amp;dn":"Alundra+%28u%29+%5BPSX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3101ab59aebcfc03f3fcb1805bb7dc7b44c71e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,1,171,89,174,188,252,3,243,252,177,128,91,183,220,123,68,199,30,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
