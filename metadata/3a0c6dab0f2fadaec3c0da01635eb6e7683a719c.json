It is a good peek into what the band is all about, and contains some stand-out moments from 2004. \n\n\nPodcast #2 (04.15.05) - February 2005 \n00:00 - Believe the Lie (02.25.05 - Fox Theatre, Boulder, Colorado) \n07:21 - Tribute to the Spinal Shaft &gt; \n14:37 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; &gt; \n25:40 - Hajimemashite &gt; \n30:41 - White Man's Moccasins (02.18.05 - Barrymore Theatre, Madison, Wisconsin) \n37:22 - Ocean Billy (02.26.05 - Fox Theatre, Boulder, Colorado) \n48:26 - Nothing Too Fancy &gt; \n70:07 - Sociable Jimmy (02.16.05 - IMU Ballroom, Iowa City, Iowa) \nTotal Broadcast Length 78:57 \n\nThe touring year opened with the band feeling relaxed and eager to stretch the boundaries. Believe the Lie is one of the newest additions to the UM repertoire, is and an example of the band's use of &quot;Jimmy Stewarts&quot; to write new songs. The chorus initially appeared as an improvisation during Der Bluten Kat from 02.11.04. Debuting on 02.16.05, it has quickly become a crowd pleaser. Also featured, the improvisation in the &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; (02.18.05) as well as the second half of Nothing Too Fancy (02.16.05) show the band's ability to create wave upon wave of momentum to drive the crowd into a veritable frenzy. \n\n\nPodcast #3 (05.01.05) - early March 2005 \n00:00 - Divisions - (03.07.05 - Exit/In, Nashville, Tennessee) \n19:56 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;^* - (03.11.05 - Variety Playhouse, Atlanta, Georgia) \n31:04 - explanation of the title for Miss Tinkle's Overture \n33:30 - Miss Tinkle's Overture \n42:08 - FF &gt; \n45:08 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;^ &gt; \n50:28 - Walletsworth (03.09.05 - WorkPlay, Birmingham, Alabama) \n55:37 - Jimmy Stewart&quot;^ (03.08.05 - Blue Cats, Knoxville, Tennessee) \n63:39 - Hurt Bird Bath** - (03.09.05 - WorkPlay, Birmingham, Alabama) \nTotal Broadcast Length 79:52 \nNotes: \n^ with improvised vocals \n* with Napoleon Dynamite theme teases \n** with Peter Gunn theme teases and Paradise City (Guns N' Roses) jam \n\nThe band's week long tour through the south yielded some gem &quot;Jimmy Stewarts&quot; that everyone should check out. Each of the three &quot;Stewarts&quot; in this episode are of the rare lyrical variety. The Atlanta and Knoxville &quot;Stewarts&quot; could easily be confused as songs to the untrained listener. The Pearl Jam-tinged Birmingham &quot;Stewart&quot; is a nice treat for the children of the 90s in us all. The explanation of the title for Miss Tinkle's Overture gives us at least a little bit of insight into the band's song naming conventions (unconventional as they are). For those unfamiliar with the &quot;Jimmy Stewart,&quot; be sure to check out this write-up. \n\n\nPodcast #4 (05.15.05) - Jam in the Dam \n00:00 - We're Going to War &gt; \n04:50 - The Bottom Half \n10:40 - Push the Pig* \n19:46 - Syncopated Strangers \n31:21 - Trenchtown Rock^ (03.21.05 - The Old Hall, Melkweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands) \n37:45 - Visions of Parin &gt; \n43:58 - Plunger (03.20.05 - The Max, Melkweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands) \n49:56 - Ringo^^ (03.22.05 - The Old Hall, Melkweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands) \n62:38 - Roulette (03.26.05 - The Riviera, Chicago, Illinois) \nTotal Broadcast Length 77:11 \nNotes: \n* with Lose Yourself (Eminem) teases \n^ with Keller Williams on vocals, woodblock \n^^ with Charlie Hitchcock (Particle) on guitar \n\nHere is a collection of tunes from Jam in the Dam. The band was loose, relaxed, and very playful. All of the bands were having a blast; you can hear the mutual respect among the artists during the Keller Williams and Charlie Hitchcock sit-ins. To close out this collection of tunes is the Roulette from their triumphant return to The Riviera, a few highlights. You can feel the band and the crowd feeding off each other's energy. \n\n\nPodcast #5 (06.01.05) - April 2005 part 1 \n00:00 - Der Bluten Kat* &gt; \n22:39 - Bron-Yr-Aur &gt; \n24:11 - Der Bluten Kat (04.02.05 - La Zona Rosa, Austin, Texas) \n28:03 - Padgett's Profile &gt; \n31:40 - How Many More Times?** &gt; \n33:18 - Padgett's Profile (04.06.06 - Temple Club, Lansing, Michigan) \n41:18 - Robot World &gt; \n44:23 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;$ &gt; \n52:43 - Mail Package &gt; \n58:10 - Immigrant Song^ (04.16.05 - The Rave, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) \n59:11 - Front Porch$$ (04.07.05 - Intersection, Grand Rapids, Michigan) \nTotal Broadcast Length 75:15 \nNotes: \n* with Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin) jam \n** one verse \n$ with Crazy Train (Ozzy Osbourne) jam and improvised lyrics \n$$ with Kashmir (Led Zeppelin) and Kinky Reggae (Bob Marley) jams \n\nUmphrey's McGee likes Led Zeppelin. If the influence wasn't apparent to you, maybe this podcast will help you out. They just seemed to be busting out major Zeppelin passages over the first few weeks of April, so here they are. Lots of exploratory segments in this Podcast, that give a better feel for what the band does when they stretch the limits of a song. \n\n\nIll put the podcasts up in groups of five after they have been taken off of the Umphrey's website.\n\nEnjoy\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a0c6dab0f2fadaec3c0da01635eb6e7683a719c","amp;dn":"UmPodcasts+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a0c6dab0f2fadaec3c0da01635eb6e7683a719c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,12,109,171,15,47,173,174,195,192,218,1,99,94,182,231,104,58,113,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
