But Narnia is not perfect: it's always winter and \n     never Christmas since the White Witch began her rule. And there are \n     evil creatures as well as good, and a traitor in their midst. Only \n     the return of Aslan can bring victory in the coming battle to win \n     spring and freedom back to Narnia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a92ec11c7eb54f595c30fd428a1a8ac436c1dce","amp;dn":"Chronicles.Of.Narnia.vol.1.e1.DVDRip.DivX-moviesfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a92ec11c7eb54f595c30fd428a1a8ac436c1dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,146,236,17,199,235,84,245,149,195,15,212,40,161,168,172,67,108,29,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
