A gentleman panhandler. One of the pioneers of Canadian animation. Oscar nominee. Poor beggar. An artist unable to create. God observing the world. Fallen angel. Arrogant. Shy. Broken. Not destroyed.\n\nRyan, directed by Chris Landreth, is an animated tribute to Canadian animator Ryan Larkin. Thirty years ago, at the National Film Board of Canada, Ryan produced some of the most influential animated films of his time. Today, Ryan lives on welfare and panhandles for spare change in downtown Montreal. How could such an artistic genius follow this path?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad2eb6e698c987a0823ce90af84a50b9a8ee874","amp;dn":"Ryan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad2eb6e698c987a0823ce90af84a50b9a8ee874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,210,235,110,105,140,152,122,8,35,206,144,175,132,165,11,154,142,232,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
