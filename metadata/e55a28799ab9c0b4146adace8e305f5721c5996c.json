Action figures are used to great effect to spoof tv, movies, music and celebrities. From the twisted minds of Seth and Matt ,the idea came up when Matt Seinrech interviewed Seth Green for &amp;#039;Toyfare&amp;#039; magazine . Matt had a regular feature titled &amp;#039;Twisted Toyfare Theater&amp;#039; in which Seth was a fan and eventually the idea for Robot Chicken came about after Seth appeared on &amp;#039;Late Night with Conan O&amp;#039;Brien&amp;#039;. The name for the show kept changing and changing due to copyright and legal reasons until eventually they came upon the dish &amp;#039; Robot Chicken &amp;#039; in a local Chinese restaurant.The dish was described as&amp;#039; Tender chunks of chicken breast fried in a light batter and cooked in a sweet and pungent sauce&amp;#039;. While Matt and Seth were working on the idea a sony website heard about the idea and approached the two about creating an internet only series. In 2001 &amp;#039;Sweet J Presents&amp;#039; was launched. This eventually became the show we know and love today, &amp;#039;Robot Chicken&amp;#039; .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55a28799ab9c0b4146adace8e305f5721c5996c","amp;dn":"Robot+Chicken+s02e10+%5BMoonsong%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55a28799ab9c0b4146adace8e305f5721c5996c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,90,40,121,154,185,192,180,20,106,218,206,142,48,95,87,33,197,153,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
