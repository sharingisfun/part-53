Clerick John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.\n\n------------\n\nThis is a GREAT movie, I suggest you buy it.  \n\nThis is the full DVD, nothing ripped or compressed.  That is why it is 5.76GB.  Use DVD Shrink or whatever program you like to cut down to size, or write using dual layer media.  \n\nThere is a 15 minute special feature with short interviews from cast and crew.  Audio commentaries are also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ac38b183cb2c6bddfa61d24f4c5ac694bf8891","amp;dn":"Equilibrium+2002+Full+DVD+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ac38b183cb2c6bddfa61d24f4c5ac694bf8891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,172,56,177,131,203,44,107,221,250,97,210,79,76,90,198,148,191,136,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
