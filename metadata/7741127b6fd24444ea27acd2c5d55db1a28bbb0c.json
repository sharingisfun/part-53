Of course the music is excellent, but Drake's albums stand so well on their own that this collection of piecemeal offerings hardly works as the best way to experience his distinctively haunting brand of folk-rock. Though a good starting point, ultimately it will only whet your appetite for the highly recommended, four-disc Fruit Tree box, which contains his complete catalog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7741127b6fd24444ea27acd2c5d55db1a28bbb0c","amp;dn":"Way+to+Blue%3A+An+Introduction+to+Nick+Drake+-+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7741127b6fd24444ea27acd2c5d55db1a28bbb0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,65,18,123,111,210,68,68,234,39,172,210,197,213,93,177,162,139,187,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
