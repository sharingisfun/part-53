It was actually DVD4.\nSo even if this one is the real DVD3, i name it DVD4.\nMake any sense?\nIn short, if you got my DVD3 release, get this one too...\nJust rename the discs... :P\n\nOn this release, i have taken away some audiotracks to see if there was any improvement in the video.\nSo all my German, Italian and Spanish friends: \nI'm sorry, but you have to listen to the original 5.1 soundtrack instead of the 2ch dubbed. \nAnd to the french:\nI don't care about you, you frog-eating freaks! Merde! ;-)\n\nThe dubbed soundtracks was 256Mb each, so there was about 1 Gb less to compress. The title still has the same compression as before(49%). and there was only 13Mb audio in the extras, so i didn't touch that. So the compression of the video is not as high as before.\n\nPlease do tell if you see any difference!\n\nSorry for the mixup between DVD3 and DVD4.\n\nIf you like it, seed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1422c7073026c7d2c071682c531b226ec64f94b","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+TNG+SE4+DVD4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1422c7073026c7d2c071682c531b226ec64f94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,66,44,112,115,2,108,125,44,7,22,130,197,49,178,38,236,100,249,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
