Williams come back together to go to Cedric's family reunion. Along for the ride are there three kids (super-cool Lil' Bow Wow, super-hot Solange Knowles and super-cute Gabby Soleil) and a wide variety of mishaps and misadventures as they hit the road together in a new SUV that Cedric has borrowed from a dealership. Naturally their trip from Los Angeles to Missouri will have hilarious consequences along the way. Cedric has alterior motives to win a &amp;quot;Family of the Year&amp;quot; prize at the reunion, getting it away from older brother Steve Harvey (in a well-timed role). He also has to contend with his mother (Aloma Wright) when he reaches his destination, but first he and his family must over-come ultra-sexy hitchhiker Shannon Elizabeth (who happens to be a black magic priestess) and even an unseen 18-wheeler driver who continues to push Cedric's buttons. &amp;quot;Johnson Family Vacation&amp;quot; is basically an African American version of the &amp;quot;National Lampoon's Vacation&amp;quot; series. Cedric and Williams have the same comedic timing and relationship that Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo shared during their long run. The kids though here are quite better than any throughout the aforementioned series. But the similarities between this movie and those from the previous series are amazing as we have an erotic stranger, a rented vehicle, a road trip, a family get-together and even a take on a Wayne Newton song. In many ways &amp;quot;Johnson Family Vacation&amp;quot; is old hat, but I still liked the film because Cedric is just such a hilarious screen presence. The others all feed off his intensity and Williams is the ultimate &amp;quot;straight lady&amp;quot; in the mix as she just seems out of place with her great looks and outstanding manners (this is a compliment to her by the way). Eventually the movie loses its way as the trip nears a close, but &amp;quot;Johnson Family Vacation&amp;quot; is still a very funny experience at the movies. Does that make it a good production? Certainly not, but it is still a legitimate rest from reality. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4160473d97598b2e74709c7881fdab7a7ea90ead","amp;dn":"Johnson+Family+Vacation+2004+PAL+DVDR-iNNSYN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4160473d97598b2e74709c7881fdab7a7ea90ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,96,71,61,151,89,139,46,116,112,156,120,129,253,171,122,126,169,14,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
