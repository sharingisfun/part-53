Even \n\nthen nobody quite knew what to call the music of Tony Joe White - blues, country, or stompin&amp;#039; swamp music, which probably describes it best. Growing up in \n\nGoodwill, Louisiana probably had a lot to do with it. But it was the first time he heard a Lightnin&amp;#039; Hopkins song at sixteen that got him hooked and inspired the \n\nhard-biting lyrics and punchy rhythms that set him apart from the rest of the pack in popular music. Sure, he had a #1 hit with Polk Salad Annie, and he&amp;#039;s \n\nhad over 150 of his songs covered by artists ranging from Elvis to Ray Charles, but nobody does Tony Joe better than Tony Joe himself. It&amp;#039;s the honesty of \n\nhis music and the way he plays it. Or as Tony Joe would say, you can&amp;#039;t listen to swamp music without moving!\n\nTracks:\n 1 - Mama Don&amp;#039;t Let Your Cowboys Grow Up To Be Babies\n 2 - Disco Blues\n 3 - Red Neck Women\n 4 - Rainy Night In Georgia\n 5 - Even Trolls Love Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll\n 6 - Wille And Laura Mae Jones\n 7 - Billy\n 8 - Lustful Earl And The Married Woman\n 9 - Swamp Rap\n10 - I Came Here To Party\n11 - Polk Salad Annie\n12 - That&amp;#039;s The Way A Cowboy Rocks And Rolls\n13 - 300 Pounds Of Hongry\n14 - I Get Off On It\n\n[b]Full DVD-5\nNTSC*\nRecorded December, 5 1980 - KLRU-TV, Austin, Texas. - 2006 Edition\nHi-Res Covers, Disc and Booklet pics included\n63 min\nDTS Stunning 5.1 Surround Sound[/b]\n\n* Please note that most common DVD-Player can play nowadays any system.
