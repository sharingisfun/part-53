The choice of single (and video) can't have helped either. A bluesy rocker in the Alannah Myles style that was popular at the time, 'I Want You' was uncharacteristic compared to the excellent, guitar-driven melodic rock of the rest of the album. With not a single weak track (with the possible exception of the single) and Lou Gramm's powerful vocal performance, it's no wonder that this album has become rightly regarded as a cult AOR classic.\n\nFor everything on Shadow King, including videos, visit:\nhttp://www.foreignerfiles.com/shadowking/mgpgsk.htm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dacef6e6859b682413f2951a93173b139a20472","amp;dn":"Shadow+King+%281991%29+%5Bmelodic+rock%2FAOR+classic%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dacef6e6859b682413f2951a93173b139a20472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,172,239,110,104,89,182,130,65,63,41,81,169,49,115,177,57,162,4,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
