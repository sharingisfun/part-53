By using a modem, anyone else who knew the phone number of these computers could connect to them, leave messages, send and recieve files.... and millions did.\n\nThey called these places &quot;Bulletin Board Systems&quot;, or BBSes. And their collections of messages, rants, thoughts and dreams became the way that an entire generation learned about being online.\n\nWhen the Internet grew in popularity in the early 1990s, the world of the BBS faded, changed, and became a part of the present networked world.. but it wasn't the same.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6fe614cbbccf0f5adc2442b186fa4467a13176","amp;dn":"BBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6fe614cbbccf0f5adc2442b186fa4467a13176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,111,230,20,203,188,207,15,90,220,36,66,177,134,250,68,103,161,49,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
