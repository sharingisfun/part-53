I tried everything \nand couldn't get them off of here.  I think its because of the way set up. All the other \nextras are included. Trailers, Bio of Sylvia Kristel, Poster and Still Gallery, The Joys of \nEmmanuelle 2, DVD covers (custom), and part of the nfo from the original downloaded \nsource DVD.  The sound on everything else besides the movie is MP3.  The stills are \nPNG's because they are lossless and MUCH smaller than BMP's.\n\nThe movie's language is English. Some of the extras are French but have English subs.\n\nXviD codec: http://www.xvidmovies.com/codec/\nAC3 codec: included.  In the properties, look for Gains and turn the master up all the way so it won't be too low.\n\nThe first movie, Emmanuelle, is on this server.\n\nThe custom covers are not by me but by the poster of the DVD source.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a82e33c0035efe4b29239a15dd7189e86a3de0c","amp;dn":"Emmanuelle+2+%281975%29+-XviD-dvdrip-subs-eng+%26+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a82e33c0035efe4b29239a15dd7189e86a3de0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,130,227,60,0,53,239,228,178,146,57,161,93,215,24,158,134,163,222,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
