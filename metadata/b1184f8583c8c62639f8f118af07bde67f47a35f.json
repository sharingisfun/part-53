It's Fable.\n\n\nThis download contains a winrar folder which has an image of all 4 CD's and a help file. You'll need a working copy of WinRAR, a computer that doesn't suck (unlike mine) and a disk imaging program like FantomCD. I suggest FantomCD 'cause I've heard that it doesn't work for some other programs and I've never had a problem with it. Just put anything for the installation code, it's been cracked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1184f8583c8c62639f8f118af07bde67f47a35f","amp;dn":"Fable%3A+The+Lost+Chapters+for+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1184f8583c8c62639f8f118af07bde67f47a35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,24,79,133,131,200,198,38,57,248,241,24,175,7,189,230,127,71,163,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
