So for a good viewing result you'll need a program that can deinterlace it on playback.\nWindows Media Player can not do this so the result is not so good but it works...\nWinDVD or PowerDVD can deinterlace on playback, just so you know!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07deba3dc6baeb2a447fe403d55958d0c00655e8","amp;dn":"Hammerfall+-+Blood+Bound%2C+Live+on+Swedish+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07deba3dc6baeb2a447fe403d55958d0c00655e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,222,186,61,198,186,235,42,68,127,228,3,213,89,88,208,192,6,85,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
