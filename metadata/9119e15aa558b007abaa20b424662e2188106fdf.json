Interview with the radio station WWL-AM, probably the first frank and HONEST report from a politician that will likely be forever remembered in the narratives of our own time as a voice for the frustration and lack of action for the dead, dying, and homeless. One of the first glimpses of the real lack of internal organization of the Hurrican Katrina rescue mission.\n\nThis is the rebroadcast ripped from WWL-AM live feed http://ccri.eonstreams.com/ccri_la_batonrouge_wskr_am.asf at Sept 2nd 2:30 AM PST. Ripped without authorization, but earlier in the broadcast they said they sent the interview to newswires and CNN, so I assume they want this message spread and was released into the public domain (and a crisis like this DEMANDS outrage and ATTENTION for the sake of human life).\n\nHis comments about the levees being the EXACT same as right after the disaster and the factor of the drug addicts bring in new, harrowing news.\n\nThe interivew itself begins 35 seconds in.\n\nI wish the best for those affected by the hurricane.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9119e15aa558b007abaa20b424662e2188106fdf","amp;dn":"WWL-AM+Interview+with+New+Orleans+Mayor+Ray+Nagin+Angry+at+Lack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9119e15aa558b007abaa20b424662e2188106fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,25,225,90,165,88,176,7,171,170,32,180,36,102,46,33,136,16,111,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
