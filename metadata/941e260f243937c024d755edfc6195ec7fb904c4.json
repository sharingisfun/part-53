With the Rainbow SixÃ‚Â® franchise known as one of the best multiplayer experiences and hailed for its immersive single-player games, the next Rainbow SixÃ‚Â® game follows Team Rainbow, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most elite counter-terrorist unit, as they are called into action into unfamiliar territory as they battle a BIOTERRORIST threat. Stakes escalate as they are personally targeted by an evil terrorist organization, ultimately ending with the capture and torture of one of the teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier members. Used to protecting the lives of others, Team Rainbow must now embark on a mission to fight and save its own. Team Rainbow does not negotiate with terror. It destroys it. The game is being developed by two of UbisoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s award-winning studios: Red Storm Entertainment, the maker of the original Rainbow SixÃ‚Â®, and UbisoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Montreal Studio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941e260f243937c024d755edfc6195ec7fb904c4","amp;dn":"Rainbow+six3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941e260f243937c024d755edfc6195ec7fb904c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,30,38,15,36,57,55,192,36,215,85,237,252,97,149,236,127,185,4,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
