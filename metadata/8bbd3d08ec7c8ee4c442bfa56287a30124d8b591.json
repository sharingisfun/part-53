The film follows the events between a woman, Lola, and her boyfriend, Mani, who she desperately tries to save from death by helping him obtain a huge amount of money he carelessly lost. It takes you on three different journeys with Lola, all controlled by fate, showing you what would happen in each, and all the &quot;what if's&quot; that provide the foundations for each outcome.\n\nTHE CHAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bbd3d08ec7c8ee4c442bfa56287a30124d8b591","amp;dn":"Run+Lola+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bbd3d08ec7c8ee4c442bfa56287a30124d8b591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,189,61,8,236,124,142,228,196,66,191,165,98,135,163,1,36,216,181,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
