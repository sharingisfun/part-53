I wasted... no time at all.. waiting in the eDonkey line for Invictus. It seriously let me download after two minutes.\n\nO_O\n\nSeriously hough, seed this time, you bastards. I have maybe six gigs left and I'm not halfway through the month.\n\nAlso, I decided not to upload my Exalted stash. The second edition comes out in maybe four months.\n\nNow, poll time. What do you want next:\n\nA) Boston Unveiled (this'll take a while - no one really gives enough of a crap to actually buy this book to upload.)\n\nB) The V:tR novels. (I have them all).\n\nC) Another stab at OVA, except with the revised rules, and SWEAR ON YOUR SOUL that you WILL ACTUALLY SEED. The last time had me uploading around 700 megs without seeds.  That means almost 19 people totally ingnored common decency. \n\nD) Anything else involving P+P RPGs. Tell me what you want.\n\nSo, vote and DL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47ee1161a7ca133d97eea398501ff8e5ef949f4c","amp;dn":"White+Wolf+share+2%3A+VII%2C+Invictus%2C+and+Blood+of+the+Wolf.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47ee1161a7ca133d97eea398501ff8e5ef949f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,238,17,97,167,202,19,61,151,238,163,152,80,31,248,229,239,148,159,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
