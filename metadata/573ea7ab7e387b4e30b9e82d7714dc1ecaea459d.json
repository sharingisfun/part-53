Derrick De Marney finds himself in a 39 Steps situation when he is wrongly accused of murder. While a fugitive from the law, De Marney is helped by heroine Nova Pilbeam, who three years earlier had played the adolescent kidnap victim in Hitchcock&amp;#039;s The Man Who Knew Too Much. The obligatory &quot;fish out of water&quot; scene, in which the principals are briefly slowed down by a banal everyday event, occurs during a child&amp;#039;s birthday party. The actual villain, whose identity is never in doubt (Hitchcock made thrillers, not mysteries) is played by George Curzon, who suffers from a twitching eye. Curzon&amp;#039;s revelation during an elaborate nightclub sequence is a Hitchcockian tour de force, the sort of virtuoso sequence taken for granted in these days of flexible cameras and computer enhancement, but which in 1937 took a great deal of time, patience and talent to pull off. Released in the US as The Girl Was Young, Young and Innocent was based on a novel by Josephine Tey. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide \n\nMore Details: www.dvdquorum.es","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573ea7ab7e387b4e30b9e82d7714dc1ecaea459d","amp;dn":"Young_and_Innocent_Hitchcock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573ea7ab7e387b4e30b9e82d7714dc1ecaea459d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,62,167,171,126,56,123,78,48,185,232,45,119,20,220,30,202,234,69,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
