Paths of Possession independently released their first CD    |\n  | &amp;ocirc;Legacy In Ashes&amp;ouml; in 2000 but their next release wasn&amp;AElig;t until 2003, |\n  | which was a split EP with Dark Faith titled &amp;ocirc;The Crypts Of Madness&amp;ouml; |\n  | which is where George &amp;ocirc;Corpsegrinder&amp;ouml; Fisher (Cannibal Corpse       |\n  | vocals) first entered the band. In 2004 Richard Brunelle was        |\n  | replaced by current guitarist Jack Goodwin and current member Nick  |\n  | Goodyear stepped in to take over drumming duties. Paths of          |\n  | Possession played locally around Florida when George wasn&amp;AElig;t         |\n  | recording or out on tour with Cannibal Corpse, which unfortunately  |\n  | didn&amp;AElig;t leave much time for a full US tour. 2005 saw Paths enter     |\n  | Mana Recording Studios/Razzor Media in St. Petersburg, FL to record |\n  | Promises in Blood, their first full length in five years, with      |\n  | renowned metal producer Erik Rutan (Hate Eternal, Soilent Green,    |\n  | and Into The Moat). Once the recording was finished, Promises in    |\n  | Blood was sent off to West West Side in NY to be mastered by Alan   |\n  | Douches best known for his work with artists such as Nile,          |\n  | Sepultura, Hatebreed, Clutch, Unearth, The Misfits, Mastodon,       |\n  | Shadows Fall, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Earth Crisis |\n  | just to name a few. With this much collective talent on board the   |\n  | end result is one hell of a brutal yet catchy metal album that is   |\n  | sure to ensnare its unsuspecting victims into its malevolent        |\n  | whirlwind of headbanging and fist pumping metal.                    |\n  |                                                                     |\n  |______________  ___                             ___  ________________|\n  |________ ____   _/                             _/   ____ __________|\n  |________ ___  _                               /_  /___/ __________|\n  |________ _  _(__    T   R   A   C   K   S    /__)/_  /_  _________|\n  |________(__(__                                   /__)/__)__________|\n  |                                                                     |\n  | 01.
