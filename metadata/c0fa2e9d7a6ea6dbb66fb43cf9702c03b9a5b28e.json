Witness the orgiastic excesses of Voodoo ritual &quot;held every Thursday night&quot; in the Bahamas, and a Puerto Rican black mass performed &quot;just 17 blocks off Times Square!&quot;  Gawk as beautiful Asian strippers are whipped and clawed from the amusement of a blase audience at a Japanese nightclub &quot;dedicated to sadism!&quot;  Cringe as a creepy guy named Jack Schwartz proves he can&amp;#039;t bleed by lying on a bed of rusty carpentry nails, then gleefully jamming one through his mouth!  Marvel at the wild underworld of underwear with a peek at Frederick&amp;#039;s of Hollywood&amp;#039;s naughty mail-order lingerie and big-breasted gals trying on brassieres in a Chicago department store!\n\nPLUS:  Lesbian prostitutes in London, male hustlers in L.A., topless bars in Tijuana, and even an &quot;Arab slave auction&quot; held right in front of Robot Monster&amp;#039;s Bronson Canyon cave!  They&amp;#039;re all here and more in MONDO BIZARRO and MONDO FREUDO, the mutant mondo double feature that asks the question: &quot;How do you know what is beyond The Beyond?

The camera looks through a one-way glass into the women&amp;#039;s dressing room at a lingerie shop, visits a Kyoto massage parlor, goes inside the mailroom at Frederick&amp;#039;s of Hollywood, watches an Australian who sticks nails through his skin and eats glass, checks out the art and peace scene in Los Angeles, takes in Easter week with vacationing college students on Balboa Island, observes a German audience enjoying a play about Nazi sadism, and, with the help of powerful military lenses, spies on a Lebanese white-slavery auction. A narrator adds gravitas: &quot;To the worm in the cheese, the cheese is the universe.&quot;\nSummary written by {...@hotmail.com}\n\nUser Rating: *****_____ 5.2/10 (28 votes)\n\nCredited cast:\nClaude Emmand\t.... \tNarrator (voice)\n  (more)\n\nRuntime: USA:80 min\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nColor: Black and White / Color\nSound Mix: Mono\nCertification: UK:X (cut) \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMondo Freudo (1966) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063321/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063321/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by: Lee Frost\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nKeywords From IMDB: Mondo, Exploitation, Independent Film, Something Weird Video\n\nTagline: We dare you to see...
