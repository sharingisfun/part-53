Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes\nyou get this too).\n\nI noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter\nthan the B&amp;W versions.  In Brats, for example, you&amp;#039;ll see that\nsome small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is\nshorter than the restored B&amp;W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.\nNote that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&amp;W versions,\nalthough this is normal if you&amp;#039;ve ever seen a L&amp;H colourised\nversion before.\n\n\nYou can download all torrents done so far by going to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se.&lt;/a&gt;  They&amp;#039;re having a few issues at the\nmoment, so all back torrents should re-appear soon.\nAny suggestions - please leave in comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9234f97e4e31eeeff1142814bbf69f11620963a9","amp;dn":"Laurel+and+Hardy+DVD+Vol+15+%28of+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9234f97e4e31eeeff1142814bbf69f11620963a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,52,249,126,78,49,238,239,241,20,40,20,187,246,159,17,98,9,99,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
