You are retarded if you haven't seen this movie.  \n\nThus being said:\n\nI have not seen a single release ANYWHERE that was the TOTALLY UNCUT 91 minute version.  MINE is the 91 minute TOTALLY UNCUT VERSION...additionally, it doesn't look like shit, in fact, the visual quality matches the dvd.  Don't think so?  Unbutton you pants, and feast your eyes on the eyepopping image quality...but make sure you have a roll of toilet paper handy, as you will surely shit yourself.\n\nI went with hard encoded English subs on this one, because so many people do not understand how to load external subs.  I also moved the subtitle frame of reference up 1/4&quot; so that it is possible to read the subs, yet to still catch all of the great facial expressions of the lead actresses.  There is very little dialogue in this film, and what little there is, should not distract the viewer from the acting, as the acting, although mostly silent, MAKES this movie what it is.\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nPlot Summary for\nHaute tension (2003)\n\nTwo female college students, Marie and Alexa, set off to Alex's parent's secluded homestead in the country to relax and study. Come nightfall, Hell pulls up at the front door when a mysterious killer breaks in and kills Alexa's father, mother, brother and pet dog. Alex is now bound and gagged, taken off by the killer, with Marie not far behind eluding the intruder. Can she save her friend's life in time? Or is everything all that it seems...?\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 938 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x288 = 2.22:1\nAudio: French, 128 kb/s VBR AVG Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: English: Internal Hard-Encoded\nRuntime: 01:30:57\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
