What's new to the game are the different &quot;grooves,&quot; or fighting styles. Although the &quot;Capcom&quot; and &quot;SNK&quot; grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves. \n\n\nGame Info\n\nDeveloper Capcom Production Studio 1  \nPublisher Capcom  \nGenre Fighting \nRelease Date February 11, 2003  \nESRB Teen  \nGameSpy Score  (Read Review)  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff56e1f6dd9bf068b944a19cb4404c4b8e54c03c","amp;dn":"Xbox+-+RLT+-+Capcom+Vs+SNK+2+EO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff56e1f6dd9bf068b944a19cb4404c4b8e54c03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,86,225,246,221,155,240,104,185,68,161,156,180,64,76,75,142,84,192,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
