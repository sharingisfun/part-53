Then you will notice Plus is running too, and can re-connect to the internet for it to work as before.\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\nRemember this is a Beta, and may be unstable. Neither I, nor anyone else can be held responsible for any damage done to your PC that results after you have run anything mentioned in this ReadMe.\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWritten by Kangie, uploaded by Joe (.@raverba.be)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d9f6db1394e38d49015b3d2ab64608a33a6baa","amp;dn":"MsgPlus%21+for+Messenger+Live%21+%28Leaked+beta%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d9f6db1394e38d49015b3d2ab64608a33a6baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,217,246,219,19,148,227,141,73,1,91,61,42,182,70,8,163,58,107,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
