Over one hundred days, almost one million people were brutally murdered by their own countrymen.\n\n\nIn the midst of this genocide, one ordinary man, a hotel manager named Paul Rusesabagina -- inspired by his love for his family and his humanity -- summoned extraordinary courage and saved the lives of 1268 refugees by hiding them inside the Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. Hotel Rwanda is PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c38d95a3a4138ec8efff82bdd90fd123f5188d2","amp;dn":"Hotel+Rwanda+-+2005+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c38d95a3a4138ec8efff82bdd90fd123f5188d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,56,217,90,58,65,56,236,142,255,248,43,221,144,253,18,63,81,136,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
