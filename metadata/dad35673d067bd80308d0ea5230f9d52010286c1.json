There were a lot of rumors and    |   |\n      |   |  fake fixes around yesterday.  Here's the truth         |   |\n      |   |                                                         |   |\n      |   |  1. This is not a codec issue.  Several people have     |   |\n      |   |  gotten the extracted movies to play by adding them     |   |\n      |   |  to another game.                                       |   |\n      |   |                                                         |   |\n      |   |  2. There is a big difference between a game just       |   |\n      |   |  requiring you to update your firmware, and a game      |   |\n      |   |  actually USING the new firmware.  GTA is designed      |   |\n      |   |  to run on 2.0 firmware and uses features just not      |   |\n      |   |  available on 1.x.                                      |   |\n      |   |                                                         |   |\n      |   |  So whats the solution? Buy 2 psps! One for             |   |\n      |   |  homebrew, and one for retail games.  But seriously,    |   |\n      |   |  this game of cat and mouse between sony and            |   |\n      |   |  homebrew developers is not going to end anytime        |   |\n      |   |  soon, so get used to it.                               |   |\n      |   |                                                         |   |\n      |   |                                                         |   |\n      |   |_                                                       _|   |\n      |_ _ / _ __ ___________________________________________ __ _  _ _|\n          /                                                           \n         /               Much love to our loyal friends              \n        /                                                             \n       /_       Caravan - ECHELON - RVF - DMU - MUPS - MODE7          _\n        /_____________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nboohooo ... hymn &lt;3 toc2rta\n\ndont cry SystemX !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad35673d067bd80308d0ea5230f9d52010286c1","amp;dn":"Ghost_In_The_Shell_Stand_Alone_Complex_USA_PSP-ARTiSAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad35673d067bd80308d0ea5230f9d52010286c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,211,86,115,208,103,189,128,48,141,14,165,35,15,157,82,1,2,134,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
