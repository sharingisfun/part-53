Guitarist Randy Hammon recently managed to wrestle licensing rights from PolyGram and now you can hear this young, punk-psychedelic outfit without breaking the bank or going bootleg.\n\nTheir self-confessed Hendrix obsession is immediately obvious. First track, Thing In E, is a speeded up version of Jimi's first album, first track, Foxy Lady. Throughout one hears similarly loud echoes. Love obviously motivated the intricate structure and well-executed tempo switches of Someone's Changin', and Country Joe is conjured up by the good-humoured, hippy-funk of Fox Is Sick.\n\nWhat saves the group from dismissal as well-meaning imitators (and from the vaults of collectors) are the glimpses of raw power they show on fuzzed-up R&amp;B doodlebugs such as Appeal To The Happy and, conversely, moments of left-field, ethnic delicacy, as on Tahitian Melody. Undeveloped potential to go.\n(Mojo Music Magazine, 1999)\n\n\nKeywords: psychedelic psychedelia hardrock blues chrisgoes jimi hard rock","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb887abf4cf07f69aa6fae7441672eaa6284d284","amp;dn":"The+Savage+Resurrection+%281968+Heavy+Psych%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb887abf4cf07f69aa6fae7441672eaa6284d284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,136,122,191,76,240,127,105,170,111,174,116,65,103,46,170,98,132,210,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
