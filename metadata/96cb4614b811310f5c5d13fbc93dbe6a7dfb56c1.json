Legend has it they were former deck chair attendants (in Stafford?!), they went on to form Nexus 21, a purely techno band. They changed their name to Altern8 when they started producing Hardcore and Rave tracks. As Altern8 they played gigs in &quot;chemical warfare suits&quot; and &quot;gas masks&quot; filled with Vic's Vapo Rub.LOL\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96cb4614b811310f5c5d13fbc93dbe6a7dfb56c1","amp;dn":"ALTERN8+-+Full+on...+Mask+Hysteria%7BTM%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96cb4614b811310f5c5d13fbc93dbe6a7dfb56c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,203,70,20,184,17,49,15,92,93,19,251,201,61,190,106,125,251,86,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
