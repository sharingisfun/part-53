Bush was sworn into his second term as governor of Texas, friend and adviser Dr. Richard Land recalls Bush making an unexpected pronouncement.\n\n&quot;The day he was inaugurated there were several of us who met with him at the governor's mansion,&quot; says Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission. &quot;And among the things he said to us was, 'I believe that God wants me to be president.'&quot;\n\nHow George W. Bush became a born-again Christian -- and the impact that decision has had on his political career -- is the focus of FRONTLINE's report, &quot;The Jesus Factor.&quot; Through interviews with Bush family friends, advisers, political analysts, and observers -- as well as excerpts from the president's speeches, interviews, and debates -- this one-hour documentary chronicles George W. Bush's personal religious journey while also examining the growing political influence of the nation's more than 70 million evangelical Christians.\n\n&quot;President Bush has been called the most openly religious president in modern history,&quot; says producer Raney Aronson. &quot;The documentary explores what that means for George Bush, both as a person and as president of the United States.&quot;\n\nRuntime......: 00:46:43\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: ~900 Kbps.\nAudio Codec..: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbps\nFrame Size...: 640x480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f603e18282a329e6d9daadc4aa0eb7d308b7d62","amp;dn":"Frontline%3A+The+Jesus+Factor+%28George+Bush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f603e18282a329e6d9daadc4aa0eb7d308b7d62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,96,62,24,40,42,50,158,109,157,170,220,74,160,235,125,48,139,125,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
