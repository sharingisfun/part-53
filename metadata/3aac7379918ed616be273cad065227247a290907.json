The story is set to a remote place in the Russian city of Murmansk. Mercenaries led by the former KGB-colonel Vladokov, have placed a nuclear bomb, and are threatening to blow it up if their demands are not met.\n\n \n\nAMMO Productions is a Norwegian production company based in Oslo, which produces a myriad of things in the world of media. We are a bunch of creative students in a non-profitable production company. We make movies, pictures, web-pages, music, programs, scripts, storyboards, texts... you name it! And we do it because it is fun; no business, yet.\n\nWe have been around for a couple of years now, and our productional activities are escalating each year. We have made several movies, such as Max Cow and Codename Ghost. More movies are on the way. \n\nURL: http://www.ammoproductions.tk/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aac7379918ed616be273cad065227247a290907","amp;dn":"Codename+Ghost+DVDRip+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aac7379918ed616be273cad065227247a290907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,172,115,121,145,142,214,22,190,39,60,173,6,82,39,36,122,41,9,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
