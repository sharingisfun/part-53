Watch videos and movies on your Playstation Portable. This software lets you convert movies and videos to your PSP and watch them in great quality in full screen landscape mode. A memorystick as small as 128 Mb is sufficient to store a full length feature film. You can watch your content on the go, from a postage stamp size memorystick. You can take any video (AVI, MPEG, DV) from any drive. Does direct DVD-to-PSP and TV from hard drive to PSP. Take blockbuster movies with you while you travel, or let the kids watch their favourite cartoons in the car. The software installs an encoding package on your Windows XP computer, you pick a file from the harddrive or insert a DVD in the drive and with only two clicks, the software turns it into a super small movie file, which will play on the built-in mediaplayer on the PSP. The headset or the built-in speaker can be used to listen to the sound. Subtitled and foreign language DVDs are also supported. Feature films look crisp and sharp on the phone and still fit on a relatively small multimedia card. The free tryout version allows users to convert 2 minutes of all content. Software runs on: Windows XP This software was not designed or produced to circumvent technology that effectively protects access to, or restricts the duplication of, copyrighted material. It has a commercially significant purpose other than to circumvent; being primarily designed to transcode home movies, tv-programming, personal video and audio files, and feature films from a users harddrive and/or on removable media. It does not produce digitally identical copies, but transcodes into a lossy, strongly compressed file. Its sole purpose is to enable a platform- and timeshift allowing playback of lawfully aquired content, under the fair use principle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1061eb70ac5d30c83a24bb60a5b17724e5b8a32d","amp;dn":"DVD-to-PSP+software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1061eb70ac5d30c83a24bb60a5b17724e5b8a32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,97,235,112,172,93,48,200,58,36,187,96,165,177,119,36,229,184,163,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
