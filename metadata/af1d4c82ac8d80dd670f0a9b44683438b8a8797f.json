Over 150 helpers and partners, most of them volunteers, turned the Romaniacs idea and the Prologue of Andy Fazekas into a huge success! For those interested in this motor sport, a Video-Premiere was organized in Stage Club, Sibiu. Organiser Freinademetz held his first Romanian speech ? then 2 hours featuring the most difficult passages, the best helicopter shootings and the funniest scenes, followed. Babu and Pushok, responsible for the video edit, showed us a really cool enduro movie, in Crusty &amp; Co style. The 2h DVD features shots from RBR 2005, but also a 20 min ?best of? RBR 2004.\nAfter the movie, as it is in Romania typical, a huge party started. Not only having fabulous enduro-terrain, Romania has also the most nice-looking girls ever.\nWith some hangover, on Sunday morning, a crew of 8 started towards the Fagaras Mountains near Sibiu, starting the snowmobile season. For those who don?t have one, and have the enduro bike hibernating, there?s the alternative:\n\nThe Red Bull Romaniacs DVD!\n\nCheck it out at your local KTM dealer. 19,90 Euro.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1d4c82ac8d80dd670f0a9b44683438b8a8797f","amp;dn":"Red+Bull+RoManiacs+Endoro-moto+Rallye+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1d4c82ac8d80dd670f0a9b44683438b8a8797f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,29,76,130,172,141,128,221,103,15,10,155,68,104,52,56,184,168,121,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
