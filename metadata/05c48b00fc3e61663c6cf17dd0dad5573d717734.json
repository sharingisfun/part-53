Jarko Grimwood \n\nDid You Know?: \nBlade II director 'Guillermo Del Toro' passed on this when Hellboy, his dream project, was greenlighted. \nAn early idea by David S. Goyer for the film was to be set many years after the events of the last film, where vampires finally had achieved world domination and enslaved all humans, with Blade being the last hope for humanity. Blade's slower aging could be explained by his vampire blood. The storyline was deemed too dark and was later dropped. \nGerman director Oliver Hirschbiegel was once under consideration for the job of directing Blade: Trinity, but could not direct the vampire-hunting sequel due to a conflict with another film. He directed The Downfall: Hitler and the End of the Third Reich (aka The Downfall - Hitler and the End of the Third Reich) for Constantin Films instead. \n(more at IMDb) \n\nSee 33 pages of content at IMDb.com, including: Movie Details, Showtimes, Photos, Opinions, News. \nhttp://www.imdb.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c48b00fc3e61663c6cf17dd0dad5573d717734","amp;dn":"Blade+3+Trinity++SWESUB++High+Quality%21%21%21%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c48b00fc3e61663c6cf17dd0dad5573d717734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,196,139,0,252,62,97,102,60,108,241,125,208,218,213,87,61,113,119,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
