It then takes an additional snapshot after the installation has completed. It then compares the two snapshots and displays all changes in a graphical tree view, marking all registry values and/or files that have been added, changed or deleted. Total Uninstall saves these changes and if you decide to uninstall the application, it will reverse the changes to the previous state. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db267590bba2bd68d0d28d30c4f9252f5aa2e827","amp;dn":"Total+Uninstall+3.41+%2B+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db267590bba2bd68d0d28d30c4f9252f5aa2e827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,38,117,144,187,162,189,104,208,210,141,48,196,249,37,47,90,162,232,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
