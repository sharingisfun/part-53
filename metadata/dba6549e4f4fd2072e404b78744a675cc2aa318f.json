The official government report said the object was simply a meteorite. But eyewitnesses to the event disagree. Some say they saw the object change direction and emit a vapor trail before crashing. Others claim to have seen the object up close. They describe it as a copper-colored, acorn-shaped object \nwith strange writing on it. Whatever crashed in Kecksburg, it quickly drew the attention of the U.S. military. They reportedly recovered the object, loaded it onto a flatbed truck and took it to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. What was it that caused the military to respond so quickly? What do they know that we don?t?
