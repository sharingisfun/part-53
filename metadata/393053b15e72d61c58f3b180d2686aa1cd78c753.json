Then go to PSP&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;GAME&amp;#039; folder , right click and choose &amp;#039;Cut&amp;#039; to take out all the folders with % sign in their names and place them in any folder/desktop on your PC. Now start cut and pasting them back into the memory stick GAME folder one by one. The folder that you&amp;#039;ll leave to put back as the last item will be shown as the first icon in the PSP crossbar menu.\n\n\nMedia Player Support:\n---------------------\nIt supports the following extensions and formats:\n \n- Video: AVI, MOV, MP4, OGM, MKV, NUT, ASF, WMV. Audio: MP3, M4A, WMA, OGG, WAV.\n- MPEG1/2/4 video(DivX, XviD), Windows Media Video, Ogg theora, Mpeg audio (MP2, MP3, AAC), AC3, OGG, Windows Media Audio\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;BUT&lt;&lt;&lt; \n\nI suggest use Xvid 1.1 stable to encode your movies to 480x272(anything above this res will slowdown PSP) and at 29.97fps with BVOP&amp;#039;s unselected. Use single pass with bitrate 1024 as max. Don&amp;#039;t use quantizer 3.0(super video slowdown). Use audio at 96kbps and &amp;#039;make sure&amp;#039; it is synched properly or more slowdown. If you keep these two hints in mind. PSP player plays AVI files just fine.\n\n\nHow to Use the Program:\n-----------------------\n \n- Left Shoulder  - Start from beginning\n- Right Shoulder - Go to Menu\n- Circle - Select the file\n- Triangle - Zoom\n- Square - Displays info\n- Home - Quit\n- D-pad Left - Rewind\n- D-pad Right - Fast forward","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393053b15e72d61c58f3b180d2686aa1cd78c753","amp;dn":"PSP+-+Exceptional+AVI+Player%28Divx%2FXvid%29+%2ABrand+New%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393053b15e72d61c58f3b180d2686aa1cd78c753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,48,83,177,94,114,214,28,88,243,177,128,210,104,106,161,205,120,199,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
