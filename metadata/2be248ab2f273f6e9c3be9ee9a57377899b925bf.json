The &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; in the middle of Nemo is beautiful, many fans are hoping that this makes its way into a new song, much like the chorus to Believe the Lie. The ebb and flow of moving into and out of Water demonstrate the band's ability to shift directions and moods. Also featured is the new tune Passing, which debuted for the first time on 3.26.05 \n\n\nPodcast #7 (07.01.05) - April 2005 part 3 \n00:00 - In the Kitchen &gt; \n12:19 - The Crooked One &gt; \n20:46 - In the Kitchen (04.13.05 - Newport Music Hall, Columbus, Ohio) \n22:35 - Thin Air^ (04.29.05 - Orpheum Theatre, New Orleans, Louisiana) \n36:39 - Jazz Odyssey &gt; \n40:21 - KaBump &gt; \n53:07 - Resolution* &gt; \n65:20 - 40's Theme (04.30.05 - Tipitina's Uptown, New Orleans, Louisiana) \nTotal Broadcast Length 75:12 \nNotes: \n^ with Warren Haynes on guitar \n* with Nothing Too Fancy tease \n\nTo finish out our feature on April, here are a few more tasty selections. The highlight is the appearance of guitarist-of-all-trades Warren Haynes lending his stylings to Thin Air. The Jazz Fest late-night medley closes out the broadcast. Even though they were just getting warmed up, they opened with some smooth playing that culminates in the frenzied finish of 40's Theme. \n\n\nPodcast #8 (07.15.05) - May 2005 part 1 \n00:00 - Slacker^ - (05.08.05 - Great American Music Hall, San Francisco, California) \n11:49 - Partyin' Peeps \n20:04 - The Bottom Half - (05.07.05 - Great American Music Hall, San Francisco, California) \n33:34 - Example 1 &gt; \n43:17 - Jazz Odyssey &gt; \n50:50 - Great American &gt; \n55:00 - Mulche's Odyssey - (05.06.05 - Great American Music Hall, San Francisco, California) \n63:16 - All in Time - (05.08.05 - Great American Music Hall, San Francisco, California) \nTotal Broadcast Length 76:37 \nNotes: \n^ with Eric Levy (Garaj Mahal) on keys \n\nUmphrey's spent three nights in San Francisco at the historic Great American Music Hall. We are featuring selections from those special evenings in this Podcast. San Francisco-native Eric Levy stops by to add his unique key stylings on Slacker. The Bottom Half from 05.07 was on the receiving end of some excellent improvisation that will give the listener a much different impression of that song than the version from Podcast #4. The frenetic ending of Mulche's from 05.06 is followed by All In Time, one of the band's most immediately recognizable tunes. \n\n\nPodcast #9 (08.03.05) - May 2005 part 2 \n00:00 - Plunger &gt; \n07:15 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;* &gt; \n14:37 - Big Heart** (05.05.05 - Key Club, Los Angeles, California) \n25:22 - Much Obliged^ (05.27.05 - Summercamp, Chillicothe, Illinois) \n38:42 - Nothing Too Fancy$ &gt; \n53:33 - Women Wine and Song &gt; \n62:13 - Nothing Too Fancy (05.13.05 - Crystal Ballroom, Portland, Oregon) \nTotal Broadcast Length 73:45 \nNotes: \n* with lyrics \n** with Baker Street (Gerry Rafferty) tease \n^ with Al Schnier (moe.) on guitar \n$ with Cowgirl in the Sand (Neil Young) jam \n\nMore highlights from May bring you a sit-in from Al Schnier, a friend as well as a fan of Umphrey's. The three-pronged guitar attack in the jam out of Much Obliged is a treat. Another vocal &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; is followed by the obscure Lounge Lizards' Big Heart, one of the few more straightforward jazz songs that the band attempts. To close out is the 35-minute Nothing Too Fancy excursion that was the highlight of the two week West Coast run for many. It is truly explosive. \n\n\nPodcast #10 (08.16.05) - May 2005 part 3 \n00:00 - Hajimemashite &gt; \n04:53 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; &gt; \n11:39 - Believe the Lie (05.05.05 - Key Club, Los Angeles, California) \n20:25 - Anchor Drops &gt; \n26:43 - The Fuzz* &gt; \n34:05 - Lenny &gt; \n40:35 - The Haunt &gt; \n44:22 - Jazz Odyssey &gt; \n51:53 - Kinky Reggae (05.12.05 - Richards on Richards, Vancouver, British Columbia) \n59:54 - Ringo** &gt; \n65:09 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; &gt; \n75:25 - Baby You're a Rich Man$ &gt; \n77:34 - Ringo (05.27.05 - Summercamp, Chillicothe, Illinois) \nTotal Broadcast Length 78:52 \nNotes: \n* with Kimble tease \n** second half, only; Jake on piano during intro \n$ one verse/chorus \n\nWe round out the trio of May podcasts with a wide array of tunes and some more tasty improvisation. The lack of a straight setlist in Vancouver led to some very relaxed and open playing as demonstrated by their seamless hopping from song to song. To close is a segment of the Ringo from Summercamp. The band opened the second set by completing the song they opened the first set with, with some inspired jamming and a brief detour into The Beatles along the way. \n\n\nIll put the podcasts up in groups of five after they have been taken off of the Umphrey's website.\n\nUmPodcasts 1-5: http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3431606\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be248ab2f273f6e9c3be9ee9a57377899b925bf","amp;dn":"UmPodcasts+6-10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be248ab2f273f6e9c3be9ee9a57377899b925bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,226,72,171,47,39,63,110,156,59,233,238,154,87,55,120,153,185,37,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
