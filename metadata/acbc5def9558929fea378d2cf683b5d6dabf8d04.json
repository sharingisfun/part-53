Also includes a rather nifty version of the 'Wild In The Streets soundtrack classic' &quot;Shape Of Things To Come&quot; (also covered by Slade and Ramones) and the eerie pop psych of &quot;No Return&quot;.

Run, Run, Run was a social comment song on the American rat race. It was included on the classic Nuggets - Original Artyfacts From The First Psychedelic Era 1965-1968 (Dble LP) compilation and later on Rhino's Nuggets, Vol. 11 (LP), Even More Nuggets (CD) and Nuggets Box (4-CD). Their album is becoming more sought-after.\n\nThe Resnicks, however, are probably best known for writing Good Lovin' for The Rascals and bubblegum hits such as Quick Joey Small for The Kasenetz Katz Singing Orchestral Circus.\n\nRev-Ola anonce:\n&quot;In 1967, master of Bubblegum Joey Levine had started writing with Artie (&quot;Under The Boardwalk&quot;) and Kris Resnick, a collaboration that was to produce practically every song in the Bubblegum genre. But first, in the spirit of the age, they produced their masterwork... The Third Rail's ID Music, an orchestral psychedelic adventure into denunciation of the advertising fuelled culture of 1960s America. One of the most pointed barbs &quot;Run, Run, Run&quot; was, incredibly, a hit single, known by everyone as a highlight of Lenny Kaye's seminal Nuggets album and leads off this redone and intensified Rev-Ola classic.\n\nThe sound of Superpop advertising jingles biting the hand that fed them featuring the full album, single mixes and the impossibly rare follow up singles, which just got more and more wicked, though in theory, still impossibly commercial! This is one of the most unusual protest records of the 1960s, attacking the enemy from the inside with it's own weapons and doing it better! And a beautiful sounding record to boot!\n\nThis is a Rev-Ola Classic of Softpop / Psychedelia and includes extensive liner notes by Dawn Eden and Joey Levine.&quot;\n\nShindig Magazine:\n&quot;THE THIRD RAIL - ID Music (Rev-Ola; CD)\n     This has to be my reissue of the month, no question!! The Third Rail may be most familiar to people in their contribution to the Nuggets CD box set (or original double album) with 'Run, Run, Run' and it's spoken middle part reciting the stock exchange percentages such as &quot;general chaos is up five&quot;. There's a similar (and even more disjointed) track in 'She Ain't No Choir Girl' and 'It's Time To Say Goodbye' is a semi-hushed voiced ballad which strokes like aural silk across your ears. These apart, the majority of the other 14 cuts (plus four bonus single versions) are sublime soft sike and soft pop of the highest order. The Third Rail were a seventeen year-old Joey Levine, Artie Resnick and his wife Kris, and a one-off gig aside were a studio entity. These recordings are prior to and largely left of centre of the bubblegum bruhaha that was to follow at Buddha for Levine and Resnick (and I love a lot of that too!). These songs feature accomplished and confident vocal harmonies, excellent arrangements, sometimes lightly orchestrated, often sitar inflected. It's hard to single any particular number out, as there are so many good ones. Levine's precocious talent and the Resnick's experience found a sublime expression in their combination that's for sure. 'Is Mr Peters Coming', 'Swinger', the ever so commercial yet terminally hip riff sounding 'Jack Rabbit', Run, Run, Run's flip 'No Return' and 'Dream Street', 'Invisible Man', pick any of 'em, they're all winners and that's not to mention a pre- Max Frost &amp; The Troopers rendition of 'Shape of Things To Come'. Dawn Eden's liners are full and detailed and the whole package is only mid-price. If you dig the lightly psych inflected pop (veering into popsike proper in places) and soft pop generally, The Third Rail is a must-have, I'm gonna put my copy back on the player right now!&quot;\n\nTrack title\n1.Run Run Run \n2.The Ballad Of General Humpty \n3.Is Mr Peters Coming \n4.Swinger\n5.Jack Rabbit\n6.Boppa Do Down Down\n7.From A Parachute\n8.Invisible man\n9.No Return\n10.Dream Street\n11.Overdose Of Love\n12.She Ain?t No Choir Girl\n13.It?s Time To Say Goodbye\n14.The Shape Of Things To Come\n\nBONUS TRACKS: \n15.Boppa Do Down Down\n16.No Return\n17.Invisible Man\n18.Run Run Run\n\nRev-Ola CREV48CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acbc5def9558929fea378d2cf683b5d6dabf8d04","amp;dn":"Third+Rail++-+ID+Music+1967","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acbc5def9558929fea378d2cf683b5d6dabf8d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,188,93,239,149,88,146,159,234,55,141,44,246,131,181,214,218,191,141,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
