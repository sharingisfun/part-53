The strings are are just a little thickly laid on in this recording for most Phil Woods' fans. That said, the title cut Images should be in the dictionary as the example for &amp;quot;Tour De Force&amp;quot;! Not only is the piano playing by LeGrand exemplary, but the ballad section is one of the most beautiful written. And of course, Woods shows on this one cut that all the other pretenders to the Alto Sax God throne are just that, pretenders. The title cut is clearly worth the price of admission. \n\n\n\nTracks\n\t  \t1 \t\tThe Windmills of Your Mind {From the Thomas Crown Affair} \tBergman, Bergman, Legrand \t4:18\nComposed by:\tBergman, Bergman, Legrand\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t2 \t \tA Song for You \tRussell \t4:04\nComposed by:\tRussell\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t3 \t\tNicole \tWoods \t3:33\nComposed by:\tWoods\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t4 \t\tThe Summer Knows {Theme from Summer of '42} \tBergman, Bergman, Legrand \t3:01\nComposed by:\tBergman, Bergman, Legrand\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t5 \tWe've Only Just Begun \tNichols, Williams \t2:51\nComposed by:\tNichols, Williams\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t6 \t \tI Was Born in Love With You {From Wuthering Heights} \tBergman, Bergman, Legrand \t3:27\nComposed by:\tBergman, Bergman, Legrand\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t7 \tClair de Lune \tDebussy \t4:50\nComposed by:\tDebussy\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n  \t  \t8 \t\tImages \tLegrand \t14:46\nComposed by:\tLegrand\nPerformed by:\tWoods, Legrand, Michel &amp;amp; His Orchestra, ,\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3fc2cc41161db57b1898a95abdd3271f85b0fff","amp;dn":"JAZZ-+Phil+Woods+%26+Michel+Legrand+-%28lp%29+Images","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3fc2cc41161db57b1898a95abdd3271f85b0fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,252,44,196,17,97,219,87,177,137,138,149,171,221,50,113,248,91,15,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
