Two mods so far (ultimate galleon and the latest greatest housing mod gold) \n   may stop certain parts of the games script from appearing so you can&amp;#039;t continue the main story. \n   This is rare but the Galleon is great for when you have completed the main Quest.THIS IS USUALLY KNOWN AS THE SCRIPTS BUG\n\n   ALways clear your cache and x,y,z drives when installing a new mod\n\nDont&amp;#039;s\n\n   Try to run too many mods at once (Your Xbox only has limited memory remember)\n   Getting giddy with too many mods, especially places to visit, will result in your humble box running out of\n   memory and the game crashing, a lot of time has been spent by others to reduce texture size\n   thus lowering memory usage but its not really known how many mods you can run safetly, and you can always remove any if \n   you get problems, just delete the .esm\n\n\n****************************************************************\n                           CONTENTS\n****************************************************************\n\nHacked Xbe for Morrowind GOTY\nTESDTK For Removing Bloodmon and Tribunal dependencies, neccessary if you want to convert your own mods from PC versions\nHow to convert PC mods to Xbox by Dyrtyrice.\n\n\n\n*****Armour &amp; Clothing*****\n\nAleanne Clothing Updated\nAncestor Armor\nDead Eldric Clothing v2.0\nFull Dragonscale 1.3a\nGondorian Ranger Armor\nIndoril WarMaster Armour and Alhanna Scimitar v1.1\nKhutulus Skin v1.0\nKnights Of Tamriel Collection\nMorkeleb Armour\nNa&amp;#039;eelrin&amp;#039; - sword resource version 1.0\nNetch Adamantium Armor\nNinja Outfits\nOrcish Armor\nSexy Daedric Armor v1.1\nSheikizza Daedric Armour Collection v1\nTools Of Tiamat\nTsaesci Dragonscale Armour\nYmsidril Armour v1.0\n\n\n\n******Graphical Enhancements*****\n\nArmour modpack by BadBoY_AC\nAstarsis Dark Elves Females v1.0\nAstarsis Dark Elves Heroes v1.0\nAstarsis High Elves Female Beauty v2.0\nBalmora Un-Mod\nBetter Heads\nBetterBodies\nDaedric Menus - By Dongle\nEnchantment Color De-Enhancer\nFantasy Colour Visual Pack \nLouis Beauty Shop v1.5 Updated\nOblivion Septims\nOrdinator Armour Replacer1.2\nQuadratic Lights\nQuadratic Lights 2\nReal Signposts v1.2\nSharpened Clothes v1.0 NelothsMouth\nUltimate Morrowind Cities Anti-Mod- Chaos Tony\nVampiric Citadel And New Armors 1.1\nVivec  Velothe Texture Pack\nXbox Visual Pack\n\n\n\n******New Features*****\n\n20 New Books (H.
