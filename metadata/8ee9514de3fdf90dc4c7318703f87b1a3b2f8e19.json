Everything has been retouched and looks amazing.  This is the theatrical release.\n\nThere have been no rips of this movie floating around.  Why?  Because with current ASP codecs, there is too much blockiness during the dark parts, and almost every part of this movie is dark.\n\nI layed off on the Matroska this time, and stuck with OpenDML AVI 2.0, yet used h.264 as the video codec.  With h.264, this movie is finally able to be watched on the PC, without all of the blockiness, etc.\n\nIt looks fucking great.  I went with the AC3 sountrack on this one, because it was better than the DTS for a change.\n\nNow all of the people who can't get past Matroska, no longer have an excuse not to witness the quality of H.264.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.  Keep it mind this is only 1000kbps bitrate, not  1800 like most xvid rips...yet it still looks better.  Wow...\n\n11 Hours to encode at 4ghz, 8x8 transform 16 references, RDO 7! ;)\n\n\n8.4 on IMDB!\n\n----\n\nTo watch this, you need only 1 thing:\n\n1.

After a bad landing on the planet, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in until it is too late.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: H.264 (x264 Revision 408)\nContainer: OpenDML (AVI v2.0)\nBitrate: 1000 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x272 = 2.35\nAudio: English, AC3 5ch 448 kb/s CBR @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 116 min\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nSome good reading:\n\n1.
