There was also something wierd about the song&amp;#039;s BPM or the grids in Vegas, so i couldn&amp;#039;t get the timing quite right, but in the end i am pretty happy with the results.\n\n-= I&amp;#039;m on a shared DSL connection, so please help me seed. Also feel free to upload this  elsewhere. =-\n\nYou can take a peak at the movie at http://media.putfile.com/Gunsmith-Cats---ACDC---TNT .
