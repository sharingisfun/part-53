Most of the real collectors have never seen an original copy! By the way the band was banned from radio stations in Australia an New Zealand because the albums front cover was judged pornographic. Their music are really great-compact rock songs and if you need a band to compare with take KILLING FLOOR.\n\n-Very rare heavy progressive rock band from New Zealand who's album was banned from many countries due to the artwork depicting open female legs protruding from a record player! ? Musically it's driving heavy progressive rock typical of New Zealand and Australia (like Human Instinct but a bit harder) In places the band have a Hendrix vibe whilst at other times UK early '70's bands such as Human Beast come to mind. Overall this is a pretty good album!\n\n\nMichael Bishop - guitar, vocals \nBob Bowman - guitar, vocals  \nErrol Bradshaw - drums, vocals  \nJohn Jeavons - bass, vocals \n\nALBUM:\n1.LUV MACHINE \t(Polydor 2460 102) \t1971 R3\n \n\n45:\n1.Witches Wand/In The Early Hours \t(Polydor 2058 080) \t1971\n \nThis is now a very rare and sought-after album of heavy progressive rock.
