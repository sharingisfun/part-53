Filmmakers Richard Ray P&amp;eacute;rez and Joan Sekler examine modern America's most controversial political contest: the election of George W. Bush. What emerges is a disturbing picture of an election marred by suspicious irregularities, electoral injustices, and sinister voter purges in a state governed by the winning candidate's brother. George W. Bush stole the presidency of the United States? and got away with it. &quot; ?the movie highlights those on the front lines ?from the African-Americans who were turned away from the polling booths for assorted reasons. In one memorable scene the filmmakers freeze-frame a 'protest' against the ballot recount, identifying participants as staff members of Republican elected officials.&quot; \n--Elaine Dutka, Los Angeles Times\n\nFrame quality:\nhttp://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y291/MPiece/u2.jpg\nhttp://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y291/MPiece/unprecedented1.jpg\n\nRuntime......: 00:49:50\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1815 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s\nFrame Size...: 512x384","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e4fb1eb73a92f2155dec832506b1baef3dc245","amp;dn":"Unprecedented%3A+The+2000+Presidential+Election+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e4fb1eb73a92f2155dec832506b1baef3dc245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,228,251,30,183,58,146,242,21,93,236,131,37,6,177,186,239,61,194,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
