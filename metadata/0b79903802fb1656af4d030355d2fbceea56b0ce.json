Its success led to Columbo being made part of a rotating Mystery Movie wheel of programs for most of the 1970s.\n\nPlot outline:\nA lawyer comes up with a clever plan to murder her husband. After the deed is done, a seemingly slow-witted, slovenly homicide detective is assigned to the case--but he's not nearly as incompetent as he appears to be.\n\nDivX Avi ripped from DVD.\n\nRunning time 120 min.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b79903802fb1656af4d030355d2fbceea56b0ce","amp;dn":"Columbo+-+Season02+-+Pilot.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b79903802fb1656af4d030355d2fbceea56b0ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,121,144,56,2,251,22,86,175,77,3,3,85,210,251,206,234,86,176,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
