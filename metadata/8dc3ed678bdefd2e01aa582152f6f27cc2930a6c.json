The CD was compiled and annotated by John Platt. Note that track 11, &quot;Dirty Blue Gene&quot;, is actually an early version of &quot;Ice Rose&quot;, from the 1978 album Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). &quot;Dirty Blue Gene&quot; was the actual label on the original tapes, so the labelling on the CD is correct. The Magic Band often swapped song-titles around, as must have happened here.\n\n\n   1.  Trust Us (Take 6)\n   2. Beatle Bones N' Smokin' Stones (Part 1)\n   3. Moody Liz (Take 8)\n   4.
