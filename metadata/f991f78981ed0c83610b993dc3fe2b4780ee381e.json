When the crooks give chase, the Three Stooges hide in a sporting goods store where Curly shoots a dummy, which they mistake for a real person.  The boys decide to bury the &quot;body&quot; in a pet cemetery, but the cemetery owner arrives from a costume party with his partners, all dressed as spooks, and they proceed to scare the devil out of the Three Stooges.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBooby Dupes (1945)\n\n    Director: Del Lord\n\n    Cast: Rebel Randally, Vernon Dent\n\n    The Three Stooges are three fish peddlers who decide to cut out the middleman by catching their own fish.

Unfortunately, their paint spattered rag is mistaken for a Japanese flag and they are bombed from the sky.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIdiots Deluxe (1945)\n\n    Director: Jules White\n\n    Cast: Vernon Dent, Paul Kruger\n\n    Moe is on trial for assaulting Curly and Larry with an ax.  Moe relates how Curly and Larry took him on a hunting trip for his nerves.  Out in the woods they confronted a bear which Curly and Larry stunned, and thinking it was dead, threw it in the back of their car, where it came awake, tossed Moe out and drove the car into a tree.  The judge finds Moe not guilty and Moe promptly goes after Larry and Curly again with the axe.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf a Body Meets a Body (1945)\n\n    Director: Jules White\n\n    Cast: Theodore Lorch, Fred Kelsey\n\n    Curly learns that he is named in the will of his rich uncle, so the boys head for the uncle's mansion to attend the reading of the will.

All the relatives must stay in the spooky house while the police investigate and the Three Stooges are given the bedroom where the uncle was murdered.

She wants to hide her singing career from her disapproving society parents while auditioning for Mrs. Bixby's &quot;Krispy Krunchy&quot; radio program.  After a run-in with a pompous violinist, the boys find the record and Curly starts mimicking to it, dressed as a women.  Mrs. Bixby witnesses their performance and is impressed enough to hire &quot;Senorita Cucaracha&quot; (Curly) and Senors &quot;Mucho&quot; and &quot;Gusto&quot; (Moe and Larry) for her radio program.  The boys show up in their disguises to &quot;sing&quot; at a Mrs. Bixby's party but run into trouble when Moe smashes the record over Curly's head.

In prison the Three Stooges get into more trouble with the warden and wind on the rockpile when they try to escape.  Released as old men with long gray beards, the first thing Curly wants is a bottle of beer.\n\n(A pretty good short, but only because of heavy use of footage from &quot;In the Sweet Pie and Pie&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Mr. Chumps&quot;.)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA Bird in the Head (1946)\n\n    Director: Edward Bernds\n\n    Cast: Vernon Dent, Robert Williams, Frank Lackteen\n\n    The Three Stooges are working as paperhangers in the home of Professor Panzer, a mad scientist looking for a brain to use in his experiments.

The Three Stooges manage to foil the madman with the help of the gorilla who befriends Curly.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSWING PARADE OF 1946\n\nReleased:  1946-03-16\nFeaturing Moe, Larry and Curly\nMonogram Feature Film\nLength: 74 min.\n\nProd. No.:  4517 \n\nActor/Actress Role \nMoe Howard Moe \nLarry Fine Larry \nCurly Howard Curly \nGale Storm Carol Lawrence \nPhil Regan Danny Warren Jr. \nEdward Brophy Moose \nMary Treen Marie Finch \nRussell Hicks Daniel Warren Sr. \nJohn Eldredge Bascomb \nLeon Belasco Pete Welsh \n\n\nStooge Goofs and Technical Blunders\n\nNo explanation\nEarly in the film, Curly says that he and the other Stooges can't read. But later in the film, we see Curly reading off of a menu with no problem.\n\n\nChange in Position\nIn the Embassy Club rehearsal scene just after Carol accepts the job of serving a process paper, Danny Jr. is practicing his song. In the medium shots, he is holding the music sheet at waist level, but in the close-ups he is holding the music sheet at chest level.\n\n\nSudden Appearance\nIn the Stooges very first scene, the club manager orders the boys to do the dishes. He strikes all three on the feet to get them to drop their newspapers they are reading, which they do. But in the very next scene, Curly is suddenly holding his newspaper at chest level. \n\n\nWrong Timing\nDuring the scene where Carol gets a chance at an audition, the boys are ordered to go back to doing the dishes, but instead sneak back and lay down next to the band to hear her sing. Danny then silently tells the band to begin playing along with her singing. All these scenes take place while Carol is singing a slow intro to the song &quot;The Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, but the shot of the band picking up their instruments and preparing to play along shows the boys nodding their heads in time to the faster-paced music which HASN'T started yet!\n\n\nWhat About the Kitten?\nThe very first scene shows Carol putting on her shoes and a kitten lapping milk at her feet. As the movie progresses, she is evicted and locked out of her apartment. The movie NEVER shows her getting back into her place to retrieve clothing, belongings, etc. WHAT about the poor little kitty trapped inside the apartment?\n\n\nObvious Stunt Double\nThe scene after when Carol faints at the sight of the Stooges has Moe, Larry and Curly sleeping on top of a grand piano, with Curly closest to the keyboard. They all three turn over at the same time, causing Curly to fall onto the keyboard, then to the piano bench. This scene has a stunt double in Curly's place with a very obvious- looking &quot;Bald-Curly&quot; headpiece on.\n\n\nSubtle Clothing Change\nThe scenes of Carol waking up with pajamas on and putting on her robe to answer the door shows her wrapping the robe tightly around her body when she approaches the door. But the very next scene, when she gets to the door and explains to Danny &quot;I have it on&quot;, shows that the robe is no longer wrapped around her and reveals her pajamas from the front.\n\n\nActor's Shadow Revealed\nDuring the scene where Carol tears up the Dispossesion Notice, she says to the Stooges &quot;I could kiss all of you!&quot; When they begin to line up for the smooch, watch the back wall at the lower-right of the screen and you can see the shadow of the head of the actor playing Danny bob in and out of view a couple of times before he enters the scene.\n\n\nWell Crafted Scene!\nNOT a goof, but a scene so well put together and shot, it is worth mentioning! The scene of Danny (just after remarking about Carol as having &quot;Opening Night Jitters&quot;) picking through the crowd during Opening Night shows him passing in front of a very large, long mirror. The mirror reflects people milling about and dancers dancing, just as you might expect it to. This means that the set had to be much bigger than the actual scene required to get all those proper images into the mirror. Also, the camera dolly and crew were carefully placed at approximately a 45 degree angle from the main action in the scene and therefore were never reflected in the mirror while shooting. Kudos, guys!!\n\n\nSuperstition Reigns Supreme!\nAlso not a goof, but the scene of Moe, Larry and Curly taking the emergency job as waiters has Moose assigning them to stations. Moose says, &quot;Larry, you take 9 and 10 ... Moe, 11 and 12 ... and Curly, 14 and 15.&quot; It appears the nightclub intentionally left out station 13!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUncivil Warbirds (1946)\n\n    Director: Jules White\n\n    Cast : Faye WIlliams, Eleanor Counts, Marilyn Johnson, Maury Dexter, Ted Lorch, Al Rosen, Blackie Whiteford\n\n    The Three Stooges are civil war soldiers who are constantly changing uniforms to avoid the opposing armies.  Eventually they decide to be loyal to the south, but remain disguised as Union soldiers.  Curly is detected as a spy, but Moe and Larry prevent his execution.  The boys escape with a secret map and marry their three southern belles.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f991f78981ed0c83610b993dc3fe2b4780ee381e","amp;dn":"Three+Stooges+100-109%28miss_101%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f991f78981ed0c83610b993dc3fe2b4780ee381e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,145,247,137,129,237,12,131,97,11,153,61,195,254,43,71,128,238,56,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
