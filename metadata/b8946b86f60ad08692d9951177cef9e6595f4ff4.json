I don't even speak french but it doesn't really matter because there aren't many words in it. This is nice because the Luc Ferrari soundtrack is amazing.\n\nThe film is all animation and maybe claymation/stop motion effects galore. Way tripped out. It's kinda academic but not in a dull or boring way. I believe there is a plot to the film, but usually I'm so amazed by the visual images that I hardly pay attention enough to figure it out. Basically, it's got a sort of early 80's industrial feel with lots of imaginative effects and scenery, bouncing balls morphing around crazy backgrounds, turning into small people, entertaining bigger people with weird headgear...Incredible, but pretty hard to find. It's worth the look if your into this kinda stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8946b86f60ad08692d9951177cef9e6595f4ff4","amp;dn":"Chronopolis+1982+Piotr+Kamler+%5BGoettersturm+DivX%5D+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8946b86f60ad08692d9951177cef9e6595f4ff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,148,107,134,246,10,208,134,146,217,149,17,119,206,249,230,89,95,79,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
