They tore the place down and the show was fucking great! This is a pretty good punk/hardcore show recorded in TrollhÃƒÂ¤ttan, maybe not one of their best but defenetily one for the punk/hardcore fans out there. I think they were a straight edge/vegan band from Gislaved. I belive this is a pretty rare recordning cause I have never seen it shared before... ..but I might be wrong. ItÃ‚Â´s cool anyway. :D\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Two Thirds - Cornerstones\n02 - Two Thirds - Frenzy\n03 - Two Thirds - When The Suit Wears The Man\n04 - Two Thirds - Questionmarked By The Letter L\n05 - Two Thirds - Creating A New World\n06 - Two Thirds - Dead Beauty\n07 - Two Thirds - Beepers And Handshakes\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be9ad42b9653d73ef72e002303771ac232634a98","amp;dn":"Two+Thirds+-+Live+In+Trollh%C3%A4ttan%2C+Sweden+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be9ad42b9653d73ef72e002303771ac232634a98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,154,212,43,150,83,215,62,247,46,0,35,3,119,26,194,50,99,74,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
