Although &amp;quot;When the River Runs Dry&amp;quot; was a minor hit, it can't save the other sullen tunes that make up this recording. Hunters &amp;amp; Collectors have the capacity to churn out great guitar-oriented songs with amiable choruses, as proven on Cut, but all that is left behind here. Mark Seymour's weary vocals keep songs like &amp;quot;Blind Eye&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ghost Nation&amp;quot; from releasing their potential as uplifting rock tunes. Hunters &amp;amp; Collectors' use of the French horn and trombones comes out flat, dragged down by milky guitar and goth-flavored melodies. There's a pessimistic aura that floats above this album, but that shouldn't mislead listeners. Usually this groups' music is energetic and lively, with blazing guitars and keyboards all afire. The cloudy cover is a fine indication that this album leans toward a drab sound, and it is surely not typical of their music.\nSearch for KingStar to find my torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f54f6487842718607bbd3f5b8e93a258e97dfba","amp;dn":"Hunters+%26+Collectors+-+Ghost+Nation+%40320+Kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f54f6487842718607bbd3f5b8e93a258e97dfba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,84,246,72,120,66,113,134,7,187,211,245,184,233,58,37,142,151,223,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
