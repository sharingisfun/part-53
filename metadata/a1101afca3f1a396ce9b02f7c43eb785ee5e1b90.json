Featuring 9 tracks over 75 minutes, the main focus is on carefully constructed layers of purposefully cosmic music consisting of deep bass undercurrents, flowing drifting, ethereal, haunting, beautiful synths and electronics, sparsely and effectively used samples and beyond. The music has vast depths, a feel of calm, and yet somehow threatening, the atmospheric equivalent of drifting out to sea on a boat close to the shore on a clam sea, watching a silent and unthreatening fog bank slowly rolling in.. There is rhythm deep within the music, sometimes there, sometimes implied and, on one track in particular, an integral part of the percussive backdrop. But, overall, this is a vast, enthralling, warm-hearted voyage into the unknown - a space journey where none have gone before, serene yet eerie. The tracks flow and evolve, always changing over the well played and arranged stream of ideas. A staggering feat of restrained cosmic ambience for the &amp;#039;90&amp;#039;s, very atmospheric in different ways when played quietly or loud. Timeless.\n\nreview by Andrew Garibaldi\nCD Services, Dundee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1101afca3f1a396ce9b02f7c43eb785ee5e1b90","amp;dn":"Easterly+6+Or+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1101afca3f1a396ce9b02f7c43eb785ee5e1b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,16,26,252,163,241,163,150,206,155,2,247,196,62,183,133,238,94,27,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
