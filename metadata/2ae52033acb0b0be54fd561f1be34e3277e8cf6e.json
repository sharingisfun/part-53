The record is difficult to listen to in places as it also charts the breakup of their partnership. Moore walked out before the end of this recording, unable to cope with Cook's drunken verbal attacks any longer. The two never worked on a major project again. Cook filmed some of the proceedings and these were released on the documentary Derek and Clive Get the Horn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ae52033acb0b0be54fd561f1be34e3277e8cf6e","amp;dn":"Derek+and+Clive+--+AD+NAUSEAM+-+Featuring+Extra+Chunks+of+Unpala","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ae52033acb0b0be54fd561f1be34e3277e8cf6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,229,32,51,172,176,176,190,84,253,86,31,27,227,78,50,119,232,207,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
