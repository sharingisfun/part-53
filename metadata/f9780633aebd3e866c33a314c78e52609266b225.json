Burnside was working on a plantation in Coldwater, MS, cutting silage. Folklorist George Mitchell was on a mission to record unknown blues singers down South. Mitchell heard about Burnside and paid him a visit, asking if he could record him. That night Mitchell returned to Burnside's place with a case of beer and some whiskey. Ten months later, Burnside had his first release. While these 14 tracks didn't jump start Burnside's career, they are stark, organic, and timeless, just Burnside and his acoustic guitar running down mainly traditional material that he arranged. This is an absolute treasure for Burnside aficionados and casual blues listeners alike. \nReview from Allmusic.com, the record got 4 stars out of 5.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9780633aebd3e866c33a314c78e52609266b225","amp;dn":"R.L.+Burnside-First+Recordings%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9780633aebd3e866c33a314c78e52609266b225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,120,6,51,174,189,62,134,108,51,163,20,199,142,82,96,146,102,178,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
