It contains 21 Looptroop\n                   songs as far as I know and one promo-track for their latest\n                   album.s\n\n                   For those of you who are not familiar with Looptroop I can tell\n                   you that they are a very political (anarchist/socialist) hip\n                   hop group from Sweden. They reside on Burning Heart Records (a\n                   subsidiary of Epitaph) and was the first non-punk band to be\n                   signed to this lable. They have had mainstream success in\n                   Sweden despite (or because of) their often controversial\n                   lyrics.\n\n                   Enjoy!\n\n     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n     01.freedom fighters                                          [04:41]\n     02.calm down                                                 [04:12]\n     03.mah grrrl                                                 [03:13]\n     04.lookin for love                                           [03:31]\n     05.fly away                                                  [04:21]\n     06.zombies                                                   [04:30]\n     07.who want it                                               [03:17]\n     08.loop troop land                                           [03:55]\n     09.long distance runner                                      [03:28]\n     10.stay                                                      [03:06]\n     11.thx1138                                                   [03:31]\n     12.conspiracy                                                [03:13]\n     13.likl supm                                                 [03:19]\n     14.positive and negative                                     [03:35]\n     15.big in japan                                              [03:46]\n     16.of men and mice                                           [03:09]\n     17.the struggle continues                                    [04:37]\n     18.kkkampaign                                                [03:32]\n     19.these walls                                               [03:50]\n     20.constant consumption                                      [04:04]\n     21.fit you haffe fit                                         [03:42]\n     22.promo-track                                               [01:26]\n\n\n\n     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     You know who we are, if not fuck off and die wanker!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1716e55776503c136a400140064c2cd50deca45","amp;dn":"Looptroop-Signs_Of_The_Times-Bootleg-2005-SDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1716e55776503c136a400140064c2cd50deca45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,113,110,85,119,101,3,193,54,164,0,20,0,100,194,205,80,222,202,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
