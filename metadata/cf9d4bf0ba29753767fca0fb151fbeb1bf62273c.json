I&amp;#039;d say it&amp;#039;s sentimental drinking music (playful and serious at the same time). My friend MSN&amp;#039;d me his album and I can&amp;#039;t stop playing it. \nThe only thing is I don&amp;#039;t know why one songs in .wav and the others in MP3 format..It&amp;#039;s not well produced but its not about the makeup, as it is about the face.  Anyways.................. \n\n.....................enjoy if you enjoy \n\n\n1 I&amp;#039;ll be Fucking Gone \n2. Half Baked Chance (drunk again) \n3. Seraphina Swimming \n4.
