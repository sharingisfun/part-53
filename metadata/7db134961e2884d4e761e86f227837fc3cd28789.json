If you've heard the term 'religious-right' thrown around a lot after the previous US election, but don't know much about it, I would highly recommend this documentary.  This documentary is not sensationalistic nor is it negative in tone; it delves into the history of the evangilical Christian movement in America and explains how this movement, which played a major part in the re-election of George W. Bush as some Americans soberly discovered, was mobilized into a powerful movement that today has a lot of power and influence.  The documentary also describes how the evangilicals assimilate more people into its movement, not only in America but also in poorer nations like Guetemala where they can take advantage of the breakdown in the government and lack of civil services to step in and fill the void and convert more to their cause in the process.  Most importantly and most dangerously in my opinion, the documentary describes how the evenglical's literal interpretation of the Bible shapes their political views, and describes their ultimate goal to establish a fundamentalistic Christian theocracy in America that is ruled by literal interpration and laws of the Bible rather than secular principles.  What is especially disturbing is how their literal interpretation of the Bible influences their political views about America's foreign policy towards Israel, specifically, their strong and unconditional support of Israel.  Shockingly, these Christian evangelicals believe literally in the end of times, the Rapture, etc, and see catastrophic events such as wars and devastatation, as well as the expansion of the historic kingdom of Israel as signs of the coming of Armegeddon and the Rapture as prophesied in the Bible.  To the American Christian evangilicals, Israel's aggressive land-grabbing and the expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land is simply part of God's grand plan and is the fulfilment of Biblical prophesy, and they are therefore against any roadmap for peace which would return the Israeli occupied land back to the Palestinians.  \n\nFor you Americans, you people need to seriously think about this - do you really want your country's elected officials to conduct American foreign policy based on Biblical prophecies and literal belief in the Bible?!  Forget the simplistic nonsense George W. Bush keeps blathering about that only ignorant Americans could believe, such as 'they hate us for our freedom'.  Actually, they hate you for very legitimate reasons - one big reason is the Israeli/Palestinian issue.  The ridiculously pro-Israeli American media will never show the brutality inflicted on the Palestinians by Israel, nor will it elaborate on America's unconditional military and financial support of Israel, regardless of Israel's brutal and bloody illegal occupation of Palestinian land.  American foreign policy is already heavily pro-Israeli, and has been for a long time now.  This is just one source of many LEGITIMATE grievances that the Middle East have with America...and Bin Laden uses this anger over the Palestinian issue to recruit people into Al-Qaeda.  So if you're American.. if you really want to deal with terrorism, start by examining your country's foreign policy in the Middle East, and think about how dangerous it is to further escalate the Israeli/Palestinian issue by electing evangelicals like George W. Bush and his like who have dropped any pretense of America being a fair arbiter of the Israeli/Palestinian issue, and have allowed Israel and Sharon to do whatever they want.  Put aside for a moment the immorality of America's unconditional support of Israel - ask yourself if it is smart for America to continue supporting Israel unconditionally, and ask yourself if it isn't lunacy to base your country's foreign policy about such an inflammatory issue on the Bible, which frankly, is simply half fairy-tales and half mythology.\n========================================================\nA major shift in American religion took place in 1979 in Dallas, Texas. That year fundamentalists took over a Southern Baptist Convention and created a deeply conservative church movement. The movement, which believes in the literal truth of the Bible, has 16 million members. \n\nThroughout the 1980s activist evangelical pastors encouraged their congregation to go into politics. The most famous of these pastors was Pat Robertson, who grants the program a rare interview. Robertson ran against George Bush Senior in 1988 and lost. In 1989 he created a Christian Coalition which has been enormously successful at getting evangelicals elected into political office. \n\nRob Bost, from Americans Untied for the Separation of Church and State, explains that the Christian Coalition was founded as a national grassroots coalition which concentrated on working its way into power from the bottom up. Anti- fundamentalist Pastor Dr Bruce Prescott, from Houston Texas, accused the coalition of attempting to create a theocracy where god and not the state would have ultimate authority. In Texas in the last 15 years the evangelicals have become a decisive and sometimes determining voice in the Republican Party, according to the program. \n\nBoth Pat Robertson and another famous evangelical pastor, Gerry Falwell, are pushing for an overhaul of the American Supreme Court which they have attacked for defending secular values over Christian ones. \n\nOn God's Right also looks at the missionary work which is considered a sacred duty by evangelical Christians. Dallas is the centre of the movement. Evangelicals have founded thousands of churches across the developing world and Guatemala is one of their biggest successes. Thirty years ago the vast majority of its 12 million citizens were Catholic - now Christian evangelicals make up almost half the population of Guatemala. \n\nGuatemala is a failed state and the evangelicals have stepped in to supply the basic building blocks of civil society including schools, after-school care, clinics, hospitals and universities. \n\nThe program also looks at the evangelical belief in the 'end time' or 'rapture' which underlies their strong support for Israel. Pat Robertson says that the state of Israel is a fulfilment of biblical prophecy and he rejects the current Middle East 'road map' for that reason. He also compares Allah to a pagan god.
