The title of the work is &quot;The Origin&quot;. Dunamis shortly thereafter dis-banded when the mountain fires spread under the lunar eclipse.\nThe music is instrumental and somewhat experimental, and owing to the youth of the group at that time (we were 18 when we were writing these songs) there may be recognized at times the un-subtle influences of popular genres. At their best, the songs hint at the un-recognized potential of Dunamis. \nThe musicians were myself, M. Epri (The Son of Iapetus); Makasa; and Antonio, whom is now working with Stereopast (http://www.myspace.com/stereopast). \n  \n\nThe track listing is as follows:\n\ntrack 1: Sunrise\ntrack 2: The Origin\ntrack 3: 3\ntrack 4: Naked Gypsies\ntrack 5: Searching (Pompous Matty)\ntrack 6: 8\ntrack 7: April Showers\ntrack 8: Eclectic Doorway\ntrack 9: Segue (Japsican Flowers)\ntrack 10: Interlogue\ntrack 11: Sunset\n\nTrack 10 might be a little jumpy at places as this was ripped from one of the last remaining copies of this work. Otherwise, should be fine. Enjoy!\n\nDunamis Tribe: The Origin (1999)\n\n -The Son of Iapetus\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83ab3eae448a084a42c4f781e885113ba9fdb77","amp;dn":"Dunamis+Tribe%3A+The+Origin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83ab3eae448a084a42c4f781e885113ba9fdb77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,58,179,234,228,72,160,132,164,44,79,120,30,136,81,19,186,159,219,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
