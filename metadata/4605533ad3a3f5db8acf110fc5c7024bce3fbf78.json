In successive hearings, the range of this CD appears in all its greatness. The music is impetuous, risky, able to evoke situations where the emotions are given a free run and adrenaline floods all our entire being. The dramatic melodies and strong sequences that appear in certain passages, provide some of the compositions with an apocalyptic atmosphere. \nThis album takes us towards the unknown eras of yesterday, but also towards the unknown tomorrow.  It&amp;#039;s retro New Age music.\nIn short, this is a magnificent album, which no doubt will contribute to increasing the reputation of this artist.  \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4605533ad3a3f5db8acf110fc5c7024bce3fbf78","amp;dn":"John+Lakveet+-+Epikus+%28New+Age+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4605533ad3a3f5db8acf110fc5c7024bce3fbf78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,5,83,58,211,163,245,219,138,207,17,15,197,199,2,75,206,63,191,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
