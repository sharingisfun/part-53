I think the result is \ngood!  I hope you do as well.  Also, of all of the \n~5000 records that I own, this one is the thickest \nvinyl!  BEEFY!  Enjoy!\n\n-Gantz\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's some text from the cover:\n\nR   A   T\nM U S I C\nF   O   R\nR   A   T\nPE O P LE\n\n(Factual data:  The music on this record is 90%\nnew:  mostly recorded live at huge parties (gigs?)\nover the past six years at locations in the bay\narea like the ex-people's temple.  The original\nFillmore Auditorium, and a variety of ethnic/pri-\nvate halls and churches.  While keeping one step\nahead of the noise police, the perpetrator of\nthese experiments in social deviance calls him-\nself PAUL RAT.)\n\nOn the back:\n\nSide one\nD.O.A.:  America the Beautiful:  Fuck Up Ronnie\nOct 31, 1981 Elite Club, San Francisco\nFlipper:  Life\nOct 31, 1981 Elite Club, San Francisco\nCircle Jerks:  Live Fast, Die Young\nMay 24, 1982 Elite Club, San Francisco\n[The Circle Jerks appear courtesy Faulty Products]\nBad Brains: How Low Can a Punk Get?:  You\nMarch 20, 1982 Elite Club, San Francisco\nCrucifix:  Steel Case Enclosure\nAug 3, 1982 Secret Studios, San Francisco\n\nSide two\nDead Kennedys:  Forward to Death:  I Am the Owl\nMarch 20, 1982 Elite Club, San Francisco\nBlack Flag: Scream\nJuly 24, 1982 On Broadway, San Francisco\nT.S.O.L.:  Weathered Statues:  Sounds of Laughter\nMarch 20, 1982 Elite Club, San Francisco\nAvengers:  Cheap Tragedies\nMay 10, 1979 Peter Miller Studios, San Fancisco\nDils:  Blow Up\n1977 San Francisco\n\nAnd then this poignant mesage:\n\nControl Through Time and Patterns\n\n-We are controlled in time by patterns:  Any\ngood prison can illustrate this, and any good \nassassin or policeman knows that to make a suc-\ncessful Hit, he must first study his victim's pat-\nterns.  Those who move in patterns can be\ncontrolled... or terminated.\n  Music has become a control process.  It can\nfunction to make boring routine work bearable\n(like muzak), to market products (things or peo-\nple), as a status ritual (opera), or as a safety\nvalve for the known percentage of rebels in a\ngiven society (punk rock, raggae).  To function,\nthis music depends upon predictable patterns...\nwhich reinforce the control process...\n  It is necessary to escape any and all patterns.\nThe way out is through the imagination and\ndreams -- To pay attention to them, to translate\nthem into actions.  And as time runs out we want\nmore out of time:  we crave experience that is\ngenuine.  We want to feel a pounding of blood, a\nrush of adrenalin through our veins that cor-\nresponds to our imaginative visions of a real\nadventure.  And somewhere along the way we\nlost the right to a trance state without censor-\nship, among allies -- That trance state which\nserved to disrupt, and break up rigid patterns of\nbody and mind.\n  In a society without meaningful symbols, goals\nor adventure, it is necessar to elude any and\nall patterns.  What was freedom yesterday is\ncontrol today.  What you hear on this record is\nan attempt to go out of control.  These are exper-\nimental escape routes, part of the continuing \nbattle for psychic freedom in a world without\ndreams... A world whose territory and time is\nbeing used up fast.  It's time to go and stay out of\ncontrol...\n\t\t-Vale\n\n\n\nProduced by:\nPaul Rat\nDavid Ferguson\n\nRecording:\nJim Keylor\n\nMixing:\nEast Bay Ray\nChris Michie\nScott Chandler\nGary Menkor\nGary Hirstus\n\nMastering:\nFantasy studios, Berkeley,\nCalifornia by George Hown\n\nCover:\nOlga Gerrard\n\nPhotography:\nErich Mueller\n\nTypesetting:\nResearch Typography\n\nAlbum Coordination:\nGerry Gerrard\n\nSpecial Thanks:\nJoel Turtle, Carol Stuart, Ian Ed, Ken Lester, Mike Vraney, Spike, Bill and Scott, Crystal, Joe, SST, \nTarget Video, KPOO, KUSF, KLAX, KFJC, KPFA, KDVS, Big Jim, Rosh Richard, Dream, Aaron, Jerry, Mike, Space Productions,\nDog, Mugger, Microwave, Jeff\n\n1982, Go! records\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f40fc72f19c594a73d0d2d59df54956c46f7cf","amp;dn":"Rat+Music+for+Rat+People%2C+vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f40fc72f19c594a73d0d2d59df54956c46f7cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,244,15,199,47,25,197,148,167,61,13,45,89,223,84,149,108,70,247,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
