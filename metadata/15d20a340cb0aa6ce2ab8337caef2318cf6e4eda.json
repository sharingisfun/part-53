Discovering his prodigious talent in boyhood overshadowed by his parents' failing marriage, Luzhin's lyrical passion for chess has become his refuge and rendered the real world a phantom. Already matched up by her family to the very suitable Comte de Stassard, when Natalia meets Luzhin, she is drawn to the erratic genius and offers him a glimpse outside of his chess obsession. But it is a world he is not equipped to deal with and his two worlds collide to tragic effect.&quot;&lt;P&gt;\n\nIf you like your movie with a strong story and extraordinary performances then I'd recommend you seeing The Luzhin defence.&lt;P&gt;\n\nSpecs:\nFile  :  1.26 GB (1.26 GB),  duration: 1:48:59,  type: AVI,  1 audio stream\nVideo :  1.16 GB,  1529 Kbps,  23.976 fps,  640*344 (16:9),  XVID (NO QPEL, NO GMC)\nAudio :  99 MB,  128 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  MP3\nLanguage: English\nSubs: English, French, Spanish\nRipper: CroakerBC&lt;P&gt;\n\nSreencaps:\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nndq.com/luzhin1.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nndq.com/luzhin2.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nndq.com/luzhin3.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nndq.com/luzhin4.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nndq.com/luzhin5.jpg&quot;&gt;\nBlack has just moved the rook, seemingly wanting to sacrifice it!
