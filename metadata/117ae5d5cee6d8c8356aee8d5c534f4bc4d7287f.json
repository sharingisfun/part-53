He's intolerant, rude and paranoid. All hell frequently breaks loose as Basil tries to run the hotel, constantly under verbal (and sometime physical) attack from his unhelpful wife Sybil, and hindered by the incompetent, but easy target, Manuel; their Spanish waiter.\n\nEncoded 2 pass with Nero Recode Digital from DVD  - Approx 400kbps each MP4..\n\nEpisode length ideal for the daily commute!\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nPS I don't have a very fast upload speed so please bear with me. I will make sure it is fully uploaded :))  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117ae5d5cee6d8c8356aee8d5c534f4bc4d7287f","amp;dn":"Fawlty+Towers+-+Complete+Series+-+IPOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117ae5d5cee6d8c8356aee8d5c534f4bc4d7287f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,122,229,213,206,230,216,200,53,106,238,141,92,83,79,75,196,215,40,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
