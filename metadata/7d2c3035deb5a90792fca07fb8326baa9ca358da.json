Dramatic reconsturctions represent his interactions with the people he meets on his wanderings.\n\nAnd, as one critic wrote, &quot;...it's just wonderful. I was left with a strange feeling of nostalgia for a place I never knew, from a time before I was born...&quot; And they are right.\n\nSo, another rare serving of Dylan Culture from your humble servant Packbell (see also my torrent for &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;). In this desert we call the modern world, such offerings are worth their weight in gold so its best to get it while you can. Listen and relax and reminice of a bygone age on what it is to be a R.E.A.L artist. \n\nTurner prize my arse!\n\nIn fact, if I did represent my arse in that moronic competition it probably would win a prize. I mean, if a bed, a garden shed and half a cow can win it...Ye Gods!\n\nAnyway, Enjoy!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2c3035deb5a90792fca07fb8326baa9ca358da","amp;dn":"Dylan+Thomas+-+Return+Journey+To+Swansea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2c3035deb5a90792fca07fb8326baa9ca358da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,44,48,53,222,181,169,7,146,252,160,127,184,50,107,170,156,163,88,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
