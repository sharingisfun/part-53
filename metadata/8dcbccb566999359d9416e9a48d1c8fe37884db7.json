If your computer does not yet have the Windows Installer, it can be downloaded from the Microsoft download page.\n\n\nWindows Installer specific:\n\nInstallers are notoriously difficult to set up correctly for all systems, there are just too many different computer setups in the world for us to think of all of them. Anticipating that some of you might find bugs in the installer, we&amp;#039;ve set the installer to write a local log as it progresses. This log is stored in the file \ninstall_log.txt\nwhich is placed in the folder where the installer is run from. If you encounter problems while running the installer, we would very much appreciate it if you would file a bug report and provide the log as an attachment. The log will be overwritten if you run the installer twice, so please file the bug report first, and retry afterwords.  If your install goes smoothly, just ignore or delete the log.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n(mac) Keyboard shortcuts with &quot;ctrl&quot; as modifier can cause Opera to crash.\n(Windows installer) A few files are not removed on uninstall and have to be deleted manually.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&amp;DisplayLang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&amp;DisplayLang=en&lt;/a&gt;\nThis is the Windows Installer if some users with old computers don&amp;#039;t have it.\n\nComments and thanks are appreciated.\n\nDownloaded from http://my.opera.com/desktopteam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dcbccb566999359d9416e9a48d1c8fe37884db7","amp;dn":"Opera+9.0+Techincal+Preview+2+Build+3278+%28Newest+as+of+20.+March","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dcbccb566999359d9416e9a48d1c8fe37884db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,203,204,181,102,153,147,89,217,65,110,154,72,209,200,254,55,136,77,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
