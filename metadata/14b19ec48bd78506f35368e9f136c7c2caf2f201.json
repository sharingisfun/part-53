(The &amp;quot;Interview  with Roger\n  Ebert&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Interview with Isao Takahata&amp;quot; are switched.) Also, when you wait\n  too long to choose an item from the extra's menu, it will switch to the next\n  extra's menu.  Since we discovered this after creating the image, we decided\n  to leave it this way.\n\n  But that's what happens when you buy Hong Kong DVDs. Serves you right for\n  being a cheap-ass, I guess :)\n\n\n  CuNT greetz : LND, TBE, UGN, Centropy, DEiTY, DOWN, EFA, ViXEN, FCR, \n                A Willing Woman, my dear friend Toby, my mom and ofcoz \n                especially my girlfriend....\n                Lube up the ol' butthole hunni.. daddy's coming home!\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   - CuNT -\n                     Doing ascii-artless nfo's since 2003\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b19ec48bd78506f35368e9f136c7c2caf2f201","amp;dn":"Grave+Of+The+Fireflies+1994+COMPLETE+DVDR+NTSC-CuNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b19ec48bd78506f35368e9f136c7c2caf2f201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,177,158,196,139,215,133,6,243,83,104,233,241,54,199,194,202,242,242,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
