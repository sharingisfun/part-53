I ACCIDENTLY DELETED IT AND I CANT SEED, USE THIS ONE INSTEAD!!  Thanks\n\nMay I present my very first torrent at The Pirate Bay, The Three Stooges.  It has 30 total episodes in a total of 4 gigabites.  The quality is good but some may not be as good.  Only a couple of episodes are bad, others just good.  I got 10 episodes from here by another person at http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3398000 .  I avoided the others because this had the most seeds.  I got the other 20 from Gnutella.  I didn't feel like the year was needed much so I excluded it.  Anyways, the episodes included are:\n\n\nA Ducking They Did Go\nA Pain in the Pullman\nA Plumbing We Will Go\nBack from the Front\nCash and Carry\nCrime on Their Hands\nDizzy Pilots (Really Funny!!!)\nFalse Alarms\nFuelin' Around\nHalf Shot Shooters\nHokus Pokus\nHow High is Up\nI'm a Monkey's Uncle\nJerks of all Trades\nMalice in the Palice\nMen in Black\nMummies Dummies\nPardon my Scotch\nSaved by the Belle\nShivering Sherlocks\nSpooks!(Colored episode, plus you need 3D glasses for it to look good otherwise suit yourself)\nThe Ghost Talks\nThe Sitter-Downers\nThree Dark horses\nVegabond Loafers (Like a remake of &quot;A Plumbing We Will Go&quot;  only with some changes and it has Shemp saying most things Curly did)\nViolent is the Word for Curly\nWe Want our Mummy\nWee Wee Monsieur\nWho Done It\nYou Nazty Spy\n\n\nHope you enjoy it, please comment here.  I need at least 25 seeds so we can share this excellent classic.  Please seed so we all have a share.  I'll be seeding for a week so.  If it doesn't finish in that week, email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ef0faf1f9abaeaeaedef9f3fff7f2b0fdf1f3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and tell me.
