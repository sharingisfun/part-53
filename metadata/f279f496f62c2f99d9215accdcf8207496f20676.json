Her children and their friends used the computer; P.S. was unaware of any file-sharing; she no longer had the computer by the time of the suit.\n\nOf the thousands sued by the copyright cartels, Santangelo is one of the first to fight back. All but a few have &quot;settled&quot; for the thousands of dollars demanded by RIAA/MPAA because they could not afford lawywers. Santangelo can't afford a lawyer either but is defending herself in court anyway.\n\nThis is the interview with Santangelo on CNN's morning show, with RIAA boss Cary Sherman participating by video. This is from the CNN site so unfortunately it is in Windows &quot;roach motel&quot; Media format; however it is better than the usual WMV quality.\n\nThere is a defense fund - please contribute.
