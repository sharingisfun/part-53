Here for the first time things like the mouse, cut&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;paste, e-mail, webcam-conferencing and other concepts that we today take for granted are presented for the very first time and this is looooong before companies like Apple and Microsoft laid claim to having invented the GUI, the mouse, etc.\nSo please, no wining about the quality, just try and enjoy it anyway ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17ef5f2a842fcb1fbad64204e349765370ebc72","amp;dn":"Doug+Engelbarts+demo+from+1968%2C+an+essential+piece+of+computer+h","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c17ef5f2a842fcb1fbad64204e349765370ebc72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,126,245,242,168,66,252,177,251,173,100,32,78,52,151,101,55,14,188,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
