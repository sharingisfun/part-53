There is a catch, though, because the longer it takes to make a unanimous decision, the less money there will be to win. If they take too long, they will be left with nothing. \n\nUpon entering their isolated living quarters, the nine contestants are cut off from the outside world, locked away, and presented the opportunity to win $1.5 million. The only thing standing between them and the money is a simple vote. If they are able to come to a unanimous decision about who should win the money, the game is over. If the outcome of the vote is not unanimous, the money clock is activated and the cash prize begins its countdown with potentially thousands of dollars lost every hour until the next voting period. \n\nIn every episode, each of the nine contestants, who include a minister, an atheist, a ladies&amp;#039; man and a feminist, must convince the others to vote only for him or her. Before the vote, personal facts, secrets and lies are revealed, perhaps helping them decide who should receive the money. As the game progresses, contestants will be eliminated from winning the cash prize, but ? in a television first ? they will continue to live in the bunker and will continue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f803d5da8587e91b7a8ec4537ca8f99a6f88d6","amp;dn":"Unan1mous+-+1x01+-+Episode+%23101","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f803d5da8587e91b7a8ec4537ca8f99a6f88d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,248,3,213,218,133,135,233,27,122,142,196,83,124,168,249,154,111,136,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
