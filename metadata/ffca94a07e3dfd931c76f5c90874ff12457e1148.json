This sync is alternately referred to as The Dark Side of the Rainbow.\n\nThis version of Dark Side of OZ is unlike any other--a handcrafted edit with precise scoring to the soundtrack. The film was edited to fit the album. There are over 101 Synchs, more than any other Pre-Synch out there. The album plays three times to the movie with an approximate running time of 100 Minutes.\n\nThis is the feature-length presentation of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; perfectly synchronized with MGM's classic &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.\n\nWorks with the Video iPod and Apple iTunes, Quicktime 7 etc.\nMore info: www.reduxfilms.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffca94a07e3dfd931c76f5c90874ff12457e1148","amp;dn":"Dark+Side+of+OZ+-+Pink+Floyd+-+VJ+DMCA+-+iPod+Video+%3A+iTunes.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffca94a07e3dfd931c76f5c90874ff12457e1148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,202,148,160,126,61,253,147,28,118,245,201,8,116,255,18,69,126,17,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
