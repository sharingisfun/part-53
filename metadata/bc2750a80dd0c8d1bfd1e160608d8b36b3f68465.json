The biggest is the lack of a clock. In career mode you can skate to your heart's content, provided that you keep some juice in your juice meter by performing tricks. As long as you keep active, you shouldn't have to worry about running out of juice. Should you run out of that precious commodity, you'll have to choose between losing your progress since your last save or spending 100,000 points to continue.\n\nZ-Axis didn't necessarily get rid of the standard time element to be new and different. Considering the size of the levels in Aggressive, no way for a two-minute time limit. And when I say the levels are big, I do mean it. Each level includes locked areas, which can be opened by finding keys in other levels. Without the locked areas, the levels would already be massive, but toss in those unlockable goodies and you have some truly huge areas to explore.&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2750a80dd0c8d1bfd1e160608d8b36b3f68465","amp;dn":"Aggressive+Inline+PAL-XBOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2750a80dd0c8d1bfd1e160608d8b36b3f68465","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,39,80,168,13,208,200,209,191,209,225,96,96,141,139,54,179,246,132,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
