In Brats, for example, you&amp;#039;ll see that\nsome small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is\nshorter than the restored B&amp;W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.\nNote that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&amp;W versions,\nalthough this is normal if you&amp;#039;ve ever seen a L&amp;H colourised\nversion before.\n\n\nYou can download all torrents done so far by going to... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45f0fb9ac15f8561095cc80ceb69df4a4287c235","amp;dn":"Laurel+and+Hardy+DVD+Vol+14+%28of+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45f0fb9ac15f8561095cc80ceb69df4a4287c235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,240,251,154,193,95,133,97,9,92,200,12,235,105,223,74,66,135,194,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
