This is a 3xcd download but worth it , enjoy!\n\n***The Off The Record 82 is of a low quality, it's in colour and the sounds great but lower than i would normally post but is ridiculously rare so i included it. The 2 extra tracks from Belfast 80 are also low quality but just as ridiculously rare so thats why i included them, also they are both stunning versions.\n\nEverything else is great or good quality. The Soth Bank Show has subtitles because it came from a Swedish TV Channels vaults***\n\nCD 1\n\n01-SLF-Suspect Device &amp;quot;ItMakesYouSpit&amp;quot; Ulster TV 3rd June 1978 SVCD\n02-SLF-4 Studio Promos 1979 SVCD\n 1-Suspect Device\n 2-Barbed Wire Love\n 3-Gotta Getaway\n 4-Alternative Ulster\n03-SLF-Barbed Wire Love Aylesbury Friars Promo By OGWT 1980 SVCD\n04-SLF-Nobodys Hero TOTP 22nd May 1980 SVCD\n05-SLF-Something Else BBC TV 1st December 1980 SVCD\n 1-Gotta Getaway \n 2-Tin Soldiers\n06-SLF-At The Edge TOTP SVCD\n07-SLF-Play For Today Clips 24th November 1981 SVCD\n08-SLF-Listen TOTP 28th January 1982 SVCD\n09-SLF-Beirut Moon Promo SVCD\n10-SLF-Harp Promo SVCD\n11-SLF-Gotta Getaway Aylesbury Friars Promo By OGWT 1980 SVCD\n\nCD 2\n\n01-SLF-Rough Trade Records South Bank Show ITV 1979 SVCD\n Essential Logic-Aerosol Burns\n Raincoats-Fairytale In The Supermarket\n Robert Rental &amp;amp; The Normal\n SLF-Interview \n SLF-Wasted Life\n SLF-Here We Are Nowhere\n SLF-Rough Trade\n SLF-Alternative Ulster \n02-SLF-Gillingham Live:-Off The Record TVS UKTV 1982 SVCD\n 1-Tin Soldiers\n 2-Roots, Radicals, Rockers And Reggae\n 3-Thats When Your Blood pumps\n 4-Silver Lining\n 5-Listen To Your Heart\n 6-Fade Away\n 7-Fly The Flag\n 8-Gotta Getaway\n03-SLF-Happy Yesterday Acoustic VH1 30thSeptember1997 SVCD\n\nCD 3\n\n01-SLF-Queens Hall Belfast NI 1980 SVCD\n 1-Gotta Getaway\n 3-Johnny Was\n 3-Alternative Ulster\n 4-Suspect Device\n 5-Picadilly Circus(Poorer Quality But Rare,Only Shown On Irish TV)\n 6-Silver Lining(Poorer Quality But Rare,Only Shown On Irish TV)\n02-SLF-Brixton Ace London W.E.Y.W. &amp;amp; W.Y.D.G.
