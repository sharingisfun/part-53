While the OfficePoltergeist server does run as stealthily as it can to avoid the victim's attention, OfficePoltergeist is totally gone when the user restarts his or her machine. \n\nSource code is available for OfficePoltergeist.\n\nMore details at OfficePoltergeist.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dcb8d1a072078c1836acbfb7d04c808c39950d7","amp;dn":"officepoltergeist11.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dcb8d1a072078c1836acbfb7d04c808c39950d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,203,141,26,7,32,120,193,131,106,203,251,125,4,200,8,195,153,80,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
