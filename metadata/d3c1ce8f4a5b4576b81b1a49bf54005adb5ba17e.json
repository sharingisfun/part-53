In fact, as the album progresses, \nthe music tends to move away from the more upbeat influences to \nthe world of deep New Age space music, all propelled along by inventive \nsequencing programming. The final, and shortest piece, is indicative of \nthis happy marriage, coupling warm atmospherics with percolating \nsequences.\n\nThe production is the icing on the cake; Between Fiction and Reality \nbeing a strong example of a competent Germanic descendent.&quot;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c1ce8f4a5b4576b81b1a49bf54005adb5ba17e","amp;dn":"Remotion+-+Between+Fiction+And+Reality+%28Newage+Berlin+School%2C+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c1ce8f4a5b4576b81b1a49bf54005adb5ba17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,193,206,143,74,91,69,118,184,27,26,73,191,84,0,90,219,91,161,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
