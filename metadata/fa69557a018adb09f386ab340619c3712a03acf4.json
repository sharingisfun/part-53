Jean Rollin\n\nThis is Rollin at his best; visual delights, sensual lesbian lovemaking, the beautiful Lahaie as a\nscythe-wielding avenger, and a group of blood drinking bourgeois women.\n\nIMDb review:\n'Fascination' is a very apt title for this spellbinding movie!\nA typically dreamlike and stylish work from the remarkable Jean Rollin.\nYup, it's another lesbian vampire movie (from a decade that produced quite a few!)\nbut Rollin, like Jess Franco, puts his own original touches to it which make it truly unforgettable.\nLike most of Franco's (and Dario Argento's) output, atmosphere and aesthetics are more important\nthan plot, and the performances of the actors involved are variable.\nRollin doesn't seem to be too concerned with creating believable characters, he uses his (beautiful)\nactresses as striking images moving across a background.\nHis movies are often closer to paintings than your standard Hammer horror.\nThat's why 'Fascination' is so unlike most vampire movies you'll ever see.\nInspired and original. Don't miss this one!\n\ncast:\nFranka Mai\nBrigitte Lahaie\nJean-Marie Lemaire\nFanny Magier\nMuriel Montosse\nSophie Noel\nEvelyne Thomas\nAgnes Bert\nAlain Plumley\nMyriam Watteau\nJoe De Lara\nJacques Sansoul\n\nFrance, 1979\nColour, Widescreen\nFrench Language, English subtitles\naprox 78mins\nXvid DVDrip.
