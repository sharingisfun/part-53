Election 2 takes the themes and stories presented in the original film and brings them to a logical and ingeniously appropriate end. Those who found the first film boring or unexciting will likely not find Election 2 much better, but fans of the first should be very pleased. So far, this is the class of 2006. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7d5b4de09216da2f5761aecaeafed1867e2d522","amp;dn":"Election2++XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7d5b4de09216da2f5761aecaeafed1867e2d522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,213,180,222,9,33,109,162,245,118,26,236,174,175,237,24,103,226,213,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
