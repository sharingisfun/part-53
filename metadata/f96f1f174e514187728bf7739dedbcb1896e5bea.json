And even if you did, who\n  has the time to endlessly tinker and play with it until you figure\n  everything out? You just want a book that will quickly show you how\n  to do things with Photoshop Elements - things that aren&amp;#039;t already\n  covered in the docs, and things you can&amp;#039;t just figure out on your own.\n\n  Adobe Photoshop Elements in a Snap is designed specifically for\n  today&amp;#039;s computer user.\n\n  --Somebody who is new to Photoshop Elements, but not new to\n  computers.\n\n  --Somebody who doesn&amp;#039;t have time for long-winded, mind-numbing\n  explanations - and certainly no time or patience for bad jokes.\n\n  If that sounds like you, check out this book. Comprised of a series of\n  well-organized, bite-sized, quickly accomplished tasks, the book lets\n  you zero right in on the one particular task you want to accomplish,\n  quickly figure out what to do, do it, and then get back to work.\n\n\n[Install Information]\n\n  Unpack it !\n  Enjoy this fine release from TEAM LiB!\n\n\n[For more information]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/067232668X/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/067232668X/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96f1f174e514187728bf7739dedbcb1896e5bea","amp;dn":"Sams+Adobe+Photoshop+Elements+3+in+a+Snap+%28eBook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96f1f174e514187728bf7739dedbcb1896e5bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,111,31,23,78,81,65,135,114,139,247,115,157,237,188,177,137,110,91,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
