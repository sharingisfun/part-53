Of these exuberant and inspiring reworkings of G.I. Joe public service announcements, my favorites include the Rasta sing-along, &amp;quot;Fire on Your Sleeve,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Help Computer.&amp;quot; Though supplanted on Fensler's own site by a cease-and-desist letter from the Hasbro legal department, you may find them on heavy.com and elsewhere.&amp;quot;\n\nh**p://www.fenslerfilm.com/\n\nI know these can be found, for free, on the net. I'm just making it easier for you all.
