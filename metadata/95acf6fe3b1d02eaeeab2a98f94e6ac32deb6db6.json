This time you can enjoy a good ol' show from back in 1999, when they released their second album Significant Other. The show doesn't have super'b quality, but it's still a awsome show, and features a interesting tracklist. One of the few times they played 'A Lesson Learned' was at this show.\n\nGo to the B2B-forum, where you can vote for the next torrent from us, that will be &amp;quot;released&amp;quot; a week from now...
