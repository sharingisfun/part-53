He has written two books claiming that he can see into the future using a 3000 year old code, hidden in the Bible.\n&quot;We may have less than three years to save our world&quot;\nMichael Drosnin, journalist and author\n\nWhat he can see is truly horrific; according to Drosnin, the world could end in an atomic holocaust - in 2006.\n\nIt sounds preposterous yet Drosnin claims to have serious scientific backing. Behind his findings lies the work of one of the world's most brilliant theoretical mathematicians, an Israeli professor called Eliyahu Rips.\n\nIn 1994, using exactly the same ancient code, Michael Drosnin accurately predicted the assassination of the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin - twelve months before it occurred.\n\nDrosnin's books on the Bible Code have been translated into most of the world's major languages and are read by millions of people. If he's right, he's stumbled on one of the most important discoveries ever made.\n\nThis week Horizon investigates the science behind the Bible Code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a68b6dde9b6fc0395e70d04d2b9d3bd61b09a3db","amp;dn":"Documentary.Horizon.The.Bible.Codes.divx.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a68b6dde9b6fc0395e70d04d2b9d3bd61b09a3db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,139,109,222,155,111,192,57,94,112,208,77,43,157,59,214,27,9,163,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
