Two of these, Dekalog 5 and 6, have since been expanded into longer, feature-length films--Krotki film o zabijaniu (A Short Film About Killing) and Krotki film o milosci (A Short Film About Love), respectively. They deal with the emotional turmoil suffered by humanity, when instinctual acts and societal morality conflict.\n\nVideo is DVD Recoded\nAudio is Polish\nSubs are English\n\nLink to episodes 1-3: http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3396269\nLink to episodes 4&amp;5: http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3398609\nLink to episodes 6-8: http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3404612","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2b3ab2cd034e58e4b5842c5f23307627b8d476","amp;dn":"Dekalog+9+%26+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2b3ab2cd034e58e4b5842c5f23307627b8d476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,43,58,178,205,3,78,88,228,181,132,44,95,35,48,118,39,184,212,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
