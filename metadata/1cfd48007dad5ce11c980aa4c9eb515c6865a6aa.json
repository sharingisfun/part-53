Granted some of the music is the same, but not 100% the same.  I always noticed a bad hiss or electronic humm disturbance on that, you?\n\nAnd where the hell was Data's Theme or the other music?  I could name at least 20 missing tracks.  Remember the Sloth jump rope music? Remember the music being played when Andy tried to &quot;play the bones&quot;? What about when Rosalita discovered the jewelry in Mikey's marble bag? The Mikey speech music, the discovery of the pirate ship music, the cavern Fratelli chase music?  Where is it?  \n\nI have it!\n\nTo remove all doubt, I found a way to get the original nagra tapes which contained the entire movie film score and sound fx from 1985.\n\nAll in all I made about 120 different tracks separating the in-between scene soundfx with the music score.  That is why there is so many different tracks.  It is very well organized.\n\nHere is what my project consisted of:\n\nSynchronizing the original 1985 Nagra tapes and putting them in the proper speed and order.  I\nalso took it upon myself to carefully Equalize the entire production.  The bass was lifted as well as the treble, the mid-range remains the same as it was originally.\n\nTape hiss will be there but barely noticeable, but remember that this movie was recorded on analog tape, long before digital made its way into cinema productions.\n\nThere were a lot of anomalies that needed to be corrected such as, but not limited to: Tape wow and flutter, sound spikes, missing audio, dropouts and pops. The sound fx were recorded on the same\nreel as the music and could not be removed, but it is good to have that as well.\n\nFiles were kept in Uncompressed Wave format throughout the entire production to eliminate\nany types of degradation that could occur if compressed.\n\nWhat you have now is the complete score and sound fx in the correct order, at the correct\nspeed, and you don't need to think about it anymore.\n\nSince I lived in Japan for awhile, I purchased the soundtrack, and I put that digital version of\nCyndi Lauper's &quot;Good enough&quot; on this as the end title (credits) track.  It is the best sounding\nversion I have ever heard, and yes, you will be shocked when you hear its digital clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is my track list as generated by Winamp, hope you enjoy it.\n\n\n123 tracks in play list, average track length: 0:55\nPlay list length: 1 hour 53 minutes 34 seconds\n\n    Play list files:\n\n          1. 001 -
