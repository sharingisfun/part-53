She writes of the difficulties involved with beginning work in the midst of all that. In fact, the album is dedicated to &quot;The Memory Of All We Lost On September 11, 2001&quot;. The disc they have produced here seems not to have suffered from the difficult times surrounding its conception. In fact, it seems to do a great job of both continuing her musical legacy, that of a considerably accessible progressive rock style that leans towards prog metal at times. It really does feel like one of the best of her career and includes some stunning moments. The early parts of the album lack a little, but as it carries on, it finds a sound that is more compelling and inspired than we have heard from her before. Lane's voice is stunning as always, and this is arguably her best work. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5b193bf923ebc21dc52873756cbf36e5c20907","amp;dn":"LANA+LANE+%3F+PROJECT+SHANGRI-LA+%3F+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5b193bf923ebc21dc52873756cbf36e5c20907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,91,25,59,249,35,235,194,29,197,40,115,117,108,191,54,229,194,9,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
