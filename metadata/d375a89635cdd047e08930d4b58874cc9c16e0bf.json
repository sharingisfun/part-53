It is fantanstic to discover a new storehouse of musical material delivering that familiar &amp;#039;Berlin School&amp;#039; (New Age Spacemusic) sound. The UK has consistently been a haven for excellent, cutting edge musical artists and Ken Martin is right in there, shining like a musical gold piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d375a89635cdd047e08930d4b58874cc9c16e0bf","amp;dn":"Ken+Martin+-+Crystal+Voyage+%28New+Age+Space%2C+2002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d375a89635cdd047e08930d4b58874cc9c16e0bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,117,168,150,53,205,208,71,224,137,48,212,181,136,116,204,156,22,224,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
