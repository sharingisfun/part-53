Songs like the barking ''I Want You Dead'' are standard-issue Slapshot, complete with Jack Kelly's familiar hoarse but surprisingly expressive vocals, but the standouts are the heartfelt and unexpectedly catchy title track and, somewhat surprisingly, a version of the Smiths'  ''Bigmouth Strikes Again'' that's not at all the usual hardcore mockery of some poncy British art-school band, but a complete transformation of Morrissey's original song into a brutal but shockingly apt hardcore beatdown.\n Seriously, who knew that a line like ''Now I know how Joan of Arc felt'' would sound so right in a hardcore context? \n\nThat sort of thing is what made Slapshot more than just another hardcore band. \n(www.allmusic.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a54cb5b74073a7bf7e2da19a4e5c75326cfa3fe","amp;dn":"Slapshot+-+16+Valve+Hate+%28Punk%2FHC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a54cb5b74073a7bf7e2da19a4e5c75326cfa3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,84,203,91,116,7,58,123,247,226,218,25,164,229,199,83,38,207,163,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
