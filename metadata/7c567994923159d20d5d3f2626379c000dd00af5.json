It's heavy and it's beautiful. At the same time.\nI've &quot;ripped&quot; two tracks, &quot;You gotta know&quot; and &quot;Mourning Pill&quot; that the alternative rock band Wakestate published on their website, just so it won't be \n\nforgotten or disappear to outer space... the pictures are also taken from their website and \n\nI hope they don't mind. I haven't asked, really. It's for the greater good.\n\nThis band has chance to be one of thelegends, if they just realise how great they are! Keep \n\ntelling them how good their stuff is, and maybe they will change their mind :)\n\nCut and paste from www.wakestate.com\n_______________________________\nSad News\n\nHey guys--\nIt's Alexxx. I just wanted all of our fans to know that regretfully, Wakestate has \n\ndisbanded due to personal and creative differences. It has been absolutely wonderful \n\nperforming with WS, and I still love them all very much and wish them all luck in their \n\nfuture endeavors. Because a lot of you didn't get a chance to see our very last show (we \n\ndidn't even know it was our last one), we are considering a date in late September with our \n\nfriends Frequency Below. Our official website will be up for the remainder of the year, as \n\nwell as our other site. Wakestate CDs can also still be purchased--though quantities are \n\nlimited. Just email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b9ced8d2dccacdd8cddccfd6c1f9d1d6cdd4d8d0d597dad6d497&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nIn other news, I have decided to pursue a solo project which will indubitably be called \n\nAlexxx Calise. Right now, it is in the developmental stages, but I will keep everyone \n\nupdated on that. For now, you can visit my personal Myspace site to see what's going on \n\nwith me. \nAgain, we thank you all soooooooo much for your continued support! \n-Alexxx-\n\n_______________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c567994923159d20d5d3f2626379c000dd00af5","amp;dn":"Wakestate+-+two+great+tracks%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c567994923159d20d5d3f2626379c000dd00af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,86,121,148,146,49,89,210,13,93,63,38,38,55,156,0,13,208,10,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
