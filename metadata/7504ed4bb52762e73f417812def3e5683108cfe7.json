Lee Ermey heads to Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky, outside of Fort Knox, for the Knob Creek Shoot, a weekend when machine-gun owners and collectors converge for unbridled mayhem. At this former military-munitions test range, shooters nationwide come to buy, sell, and trade. First, the Gunny shows us around, talks about the history, hits sales tables, and fires off a few thousand rounds--from state-of-the-art to early vintage. Next, Lee takes a turn on the &quot;Jungle Walk&quot;, a machine-gun shooting course with hidden targets and dense brush to recreate what it was like for the grunts in Viet Nam; and he gets a lift on a mule to the Knob Creek helipad where he goes aloft in a Cayuse OH-6A Helicopter for the range's aerial shooting course. Then, it's the night shoot, when you really get to see raw power as machine guns shoot tracers and fire at targets filled with diesel fuel and dynamite, incinerating cars, refrigerators, and oil drums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7504ed4bb52762e73f417812def3e5683108cfe7","amp;dn":"Knob+Creek+Machinegun+Shoot+on+Mail+Call","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7504ed4bb52762e73f417812def3e5683108cfe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,4,237,75,181,39,98,231,63,65,120,18,222,243,229,104,49,8,207,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
