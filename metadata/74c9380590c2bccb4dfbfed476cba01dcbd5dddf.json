In fact, after listening to its 17 tracks -- which include duets with Nanci Griffith, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and others -- the only remaining question about Russell is: Why isn't this guy very, very famous? Sure, you can hear lots of influences here -- everyone from Merle Haggard and Buck Owens to Ian Tyson (a sometime collaborator) and Bob Dylan. But the end product is an artist with an instantly recognizable, personal sound. It's a little bit country, a little bit folk, a little bit rock, with lots of great picking, lilting melodies, and consistently first-rate lyrics that sound like the result of experience and conviction, not the desire to impress or score hits -- but he sure does impress. There isn't a clunker in the bunch, but if forced to pick highlights, one might list &quot;Beyond the Blues,&quot; a duet with Gilmore; &quot;U.S. Steel,&quot; with guitar and vocal reminiscent of early Johnny Cash; &quot;Walkin' on the Moon,&quot; which Russell wrote and performs with Katy Moffat; and &quot;Gallo del Cielo,&quot; an exuberant south-of the-border excursion.\n1.
