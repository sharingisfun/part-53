Just have a listen to the opener ?Bestia? (Beast) and you?ll hear how his voice is able to thrill, and even scare so easily you won?t mind that you probably have no idea what he?s talking about! The following title-track begins with some growl lines and goes on very fast with powerful drumming and strong guitars, always changing time and rhythm, while ?Recita? is a new-prog track that slows down a little bit. ?Tango Di Paura? features an interesting organ but the singer?s voice is, in my opinion, too high; ?Cercando La Mia Ombra? moves towards a symphonic direction, and sounds a lot like Symphony X, but the real surprise is its funky ending which makes this long track rather funny. \n\nThe band is getting enthusiastic reviews from Italy and other European countries, and I totally agree with those who say these five guys will go very far. It?s not easy nowadays to find young bands with the same enthusiasm, innovating attitude, deep lyrics and technical skills. All I can say is I think Algol3 deserve to be discovered; right now they are attracting some local labels attention, and I?m sure they will soon come up with a great debut album!\n\nwww.ALGOL3.it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:006f3555042e7b8b0a884b988d9849118ee9952f","amp;dn":"ALGOL3+italian+prog+metal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"006f3555042e7b8b0a884b988d9849118ee9952f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,111,53,85,4,46,123,139,10,136,75,152,141,152,73,17,142,233,149,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
