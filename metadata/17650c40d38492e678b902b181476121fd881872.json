We kept all extras to give u something more.\n There is a teaser of Ice Age 2 and some more things :)\n \n Reason why we dont tag it PROPER is because we dont kept the\n finnish audio, and because the NoGrp release works on some\n dvd-systems.\n But still, end credits missing!\n \n \n Over and out...\n \n Someone good @ ascii?
