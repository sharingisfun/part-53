Some call it neo-psychedelia, but I would say that they have their completely own music style (even though this term is over-used). Influenced by the 60&amp;#039;s, added some really psychedelic organ playing, and finally combined with some great song writing. Check the Trivia/Links for more information.\n\nThe Days of Pearly Spencer is a collection of unreleased material, including re-recordings of earlier songs (from their first album 1983). This album is from 1988, and was their final album under the name The Vietnam Veterans.\n\nTracks:\n01. The Days Of Pearly Spencer (4:22)\n02. 500 Miles (5:54)\n03.
