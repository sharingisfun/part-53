This is the cd that is included with &quot;A Concise Introduction To Logic&quot; 9th edition by Hurley. I believe that it is just the practice tests, but I haven't really looked at it. It should not be used instead of a book. This is if you lost your copy, or you found a cheap version of the book online that doesn't include the cd, but you need it. I hope to do the same thing with the practice tests; but that will only happen given the right recourses, so I wouldn't count on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b12b54c5329211f85272db4056d18e9e7f774620","amp;dn":"LearningLogic4+the+CD+included+with+%5C%22A+Concise+Introduction+To","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b12b54c5329211f85272db4056d18e9e7f774620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,43,84,197,50,146,17,248,82,114,219,64,86,209,142,158,127,119,70,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
