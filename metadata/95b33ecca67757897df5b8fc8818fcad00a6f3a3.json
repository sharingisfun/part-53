Over a period of six years, 1939 to 1945, more than 50 million human beings died by violence, disease, exposure, or starvation, as a direct result of the war. In The Big Battles you&amp;#039;ll see newsreel and combat footage combined with latter-day interviews with military personnel who experienced the war first-hand. The Big Battles box set contains all five DVD Volumes in the series. Each volume contains three 50-minute episodes, with each episode depicting a separate campaign of this most horrible of wars. Over 750 minutes of incredible history has been preserved in digital quality!

Most turned out to be 565 MB (approx) but a few were longer so they ended up a little bigger.  \n\nAn nfo.html file will be included in both of the uploads, DVD1 &amp; DVD2.  It will include links to all the files.  Whichever DVD you are downloading right now, when you are done with all of the files, the links in the nfo.html will work to the files of that DVD.  If you have the other DVD folder on your drive in the same directory as this nfo.html file, the other DVD&amp;#039;s links will work too:\n\n--&gt; The Big Battles of WWII -XviD-DVDrips\n-----&gt; DVD1\n-----&gt; DVD2\n-----&gt; The Big Battles of WWII -XviD-DVDrips.nfo.html\n-----&gt; tBBoWWII.jpg\n\nThanks to Warmonger, once again, for posting these great disks!\t\t\n\nDisk 1 is at http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3440783 _for now_....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95b33ecca67757897df5b8fc8818fcad00a6f3a3","amp;dn":"The+Big+Battles+of+WWII+-XviD-DVDrips+DVD2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95b33ecca67757897df5b8fc8818fcad00a6f3a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,179,62,204,166,119,87,137,125,245,184,252,136,24,252,173,0,166,243,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
