Many times, there is not much in the way of instrumentation; most of the songs are anchored around his singing and acoustic guitar playing.  It is undeniably African-influenced, with much exotic percussion, but it is also grounded in Voodoo beliefs found in the West Indies.  His guitar playing is solid, but not flashy. He once said in an\ninterview, &quot;I only know a few chords, but I can stretch them out!&quot;  His greatest instrument was his voice.  It was a thing of ragged beauty.  Neither too high nor low, it compelled and beckoned, sounding as if he had experienced many things in many planes. \n\n\nfor further information on Exuma:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.furious.com/Perfect/exuma.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.furious.com/Perfect/exuma.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39d8097beb366e6e68e457d616bd95f41607be3","amp;dn":"Exuma+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39d8097beb366e6e68e457d616bd95f41607be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,157,128,151,190,179,102,230,230,142,69,125,97,107,217,95,65,96,123,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
