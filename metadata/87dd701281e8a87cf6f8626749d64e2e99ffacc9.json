On the night of the 25th, when servicemen spot a glowing object in the woods, they investigate and come upon a triangular \n\nmetallic craft. One of them touches it and records strange etchings in his notebook. It shoots above the treetops and the men are later found in a daze by \n\nother troops. Two nights later, the Deputy Base Commander and a team investigating the alleged site see lights over a field beyond the woods and a red \n\nobject. It speeds off, beaming lights over the bases. Some witnesses allege use of force and sodium pentothal during interrogation. A memorandum issued by \n\nthe Deputy Base Commander, which records some statements, is later released via the Freedom of Information Act. More files are released in 2002 but, to this \n\nday, the events remain a mystery. We'll try to unravel it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87dd701281e8a87cf6f8626749d64e2e99ffacc9","amp;dn":"%5BHistory+Channel%5D+UFO+Files+-+Britain%5C%27s+Roswell.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87dd701281e8a87cf6f8626749d64e2e99ffacc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,221,112,18,129,232,168,124,246,248,98,103,73,214,78,46,153,255,172,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
