Anne Pope \n\n\nPLOT:\n\nmust say! This is a good movie, with a corny ending like A.I, it \nstarted off as a thriller and ended up a Sci-fi although the \nconnection was a perfect blend. The Director made good use of the \ngaps created by the story to fuse the two genre's together. Dominic \nWest is a new comer to the big screen (playing only minor roles in\nother movies) but his level of proffesionalism made him a wild card\nin this movie and he delivered. Just like how &amp;quot;two smoking barrels \nmade jason Statham a big Hollywood actor, hope to see him in more\nmovies. Julian Moore a veteran of the industry showed her dominance \nas always...much appreciated Julian. The only thing that didn't\nreally make sense was her husband not being there in end. The story\nline should have taken them back before the abduction occurred so as\nto make the ending a happier one...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf969ec903b324f08d223a7b3a32a0c79186301b","amp;dn":"The.Forgotten.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-POiNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf969ec903b324f08d223a7b3a32a0c79186301b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,150,158,201,3,179,36,240,141,34,58,123,58,50,160,199,145,134,48,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
