For those of you keeping score, that's 3 whole episodes. This was done just for those of you who know or are someone that has missed the return of the show and needs to catch up. Also, this is aimed at the people who demand to see it on an old school 4:3 television. If you wish to watch the episodes on your computer I am sorry you wasted your time; You need to get the AVI releases. Just to clarify, the DVDR Folder contains DVD-Video files that must be burned to a disc and watched on a real DVD player. I repeat; there is no windows program that can play these files properly; TRUST ME!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e052051e5fa2687b894472850c6a6f08a65079e6","amp;dn":"the.OC.Season.3.English.DVDR.NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e052051e5fa2687b894472850c6a6f08a65079e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,82,5,30,95,162,104,123,137,68,114,133,12,106,111,8,166,80,121,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
