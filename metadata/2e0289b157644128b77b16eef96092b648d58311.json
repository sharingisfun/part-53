DVD Cloner 2 makes backing up your copy-protected DVD movies simple. With your DVD burner and DVD Cloner software, you pop in the DVD you want to copy in your DVD-ROM and a blank DVD in your DVD Burner and click the button to start the DVD burning process. You can clone your DVD entirely within 2-3 hours, in the same quality as the original. The cloned DVD can be played in any compatible DVD Player. Plus, DVD Cloner 2 is one of the few DVD backup software titles that has a built-in CSS/DVD Ripper. You do not need to download a separate program like DVD43 or AnyDVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0289b157644128b77b16eef96092b648d58311","amp;dn":"DVD-Cloner+II+2.62+Build+850","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0289b157644128b77b16eef96092b648d58311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,2,137,177,87,100,65,40,183,123,22,238,249,96,146,182,72,213,131,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
