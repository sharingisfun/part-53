Death is an Adviser (0:00 - 3:36)\n\n??In this short life of mine,\nwhich feels so much like the life of an immortal\nthat has lived for too long, I often think of embracing Death.\nOh, how I wish to see and experience the spectral realms.\nI have come to think that perhaps there is more life in death\nthan there is life in life; Modern life, the unlife.\nI want to care about nothing and be free to do as I wish.\nA wanderlust grows in me, but beautiful landscapes\nto tread are withering away -- becoming a graveyard of stone,\nmetal, and the technology of disintegral civilization.\nI want to be alone. I want to see no way.?\n?Gogues must be routed, or ?til death man be Enslaved.\nBut by the antic nature of Faust and his raising inabstain [taking action],\nby the will of ourselves can we go\nbeyond [the beyond] in the thoughts [and actions]\nof the SELF gathered.\nNothing isn?t existence?everything is existence.\nIn whatever form [today],\nthe ?self? [commune] will only give its own view of wisdom\n[developed solely for its mere self-image].\nEach novel breed &amp; descent\nforever...have a becoming distinction.\nPay attention -- let senses be heightened:\nsilence [?peace?] turns into clamor [WAR].\nSurroundings visible like waking up from minds of the drowned.\n?Uncertain terrible dreams??\nThe only truer art is SUFFERING (beautiful suffering).\n[What does not kill you makes you...]\n?I?ve slept for too long\nand I have woken up too soon!\nWhy can?t I sleep forever?? he asked again.\nFool?the beauty of torment is in evolution!\nBut in your [misguided] deconstruction?\n?I'M LOST IN THE CASTLE OF LIES...EVERMORE!?\nHmph?\nYou are to walk out in a death that will be your catharsis.\n\n2. Overcome this Crisis of the Modern World (3:37 - 7:53)\n\nNotions spinning in their head like webs.\nYou came here to see their gnostic evil.\nTheir hearts bleeding out the rustic pain.\nYou are the vessels of hollow ice.\nTook in vain their [the slaves] hate pumped veins.\nThey love the mere thought of slaying\nin this habitat of lowly plight.\nRising fires, falling ashes, dust till one thousand nights,\nritual cuts and destructive gashes.\nComrades admitted into the [unholy] masses --\nnow Darkness invokes his wrath!\nThe slaves are programmed, downloading decadence\n-- overridden and overloaded, something crueler every day.\nMake a new society -- now we have to de-gray -- \n?cause everything here is falling apart.\nAll the fallen foliage has made man unsharp.\nTear down the static of these expired gardens,\njust our roots remain.\nThere is no identity to those who have been cloned\nand with no soul -- APATHETIC.\nThought you?ve been living?\nYou truly are not, ?cause?you are?the synthetic.\nA Diamond Age would attempt\nto plunge us into thorough obscurity,\nbut I will be free and valiant\nas long as I and my people are whole.\nTogether, one!\nChampions, not with guilt,\nrivet through their [the slaves] utter hatred.\nOvercome destructive emotion.\n\n3.
