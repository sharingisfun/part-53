He also presented his own background as an abductee for thirteen years beginning at the age of 3Ã‚Â¢. The 5 ft. tall entity with large black eyes, that he repeatedly encountered, did not have any genitalia or a belly button, leading Sims to conclude that it was &quot;not born&quot; but &quot;cloned, hatched or manufactured.&quot;\n\nHis profiles of abductees show that a statistically significant portion of them are Native American, Celtic or Irish, have rare allergies to procaine products, and experience nosebleeds. Nasal implants (pictured below) were sent by Sims to the University of York for study, and while it was found that they were 51% silver and 49% gold, their surface could not be readily recreated. Interestingly, he believes that alien implants do not contain obvious signs of technology (in contrast to human-produced implants) and that they may be altering neurotransmitters, as some abductees show unusual levels of serotonin and dopamine.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                               \n  \n=-=\n\n|| [outdated] C2C List: http://utopiated.net/docs/c2c-compiled-list-htm.html  ||  Archived and seeded by davID@!UtopiAted!Net!   ||","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:537cc8a812377e4179fddf1deae047bf2aa3a28b","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast++Alien-Hunter-31st-Jan-2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"537cc8a812377e4179fddf1deae047bf2aa3a28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,124,200,168,18,55,126,65,121,253,223,29,234,224,71,191,42,163,162,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
