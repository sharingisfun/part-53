He works at a Starbucks and is obsessed with the Beatles. He has a daughter with a homeless woman; she abandons them as soon as they leave the hospital. He names his daughter Lucy Diamond (after the Beatles song), and raises her. But as she reaches age 7 herself, Sam's limitations start to become a problem at school; she's intentionally holding back to avoid looking smarter than him. The authorities take her away, and Sam shames high-priced lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pheiffer) into taking his case pro bono. In the process, he teaches her a great deal about love, and whether it's really all you need.\n\nAwards:\nSean Penn was nominated for an Oscar: Best Actor in a Leading Role 2001.\nIMDB-Raiting:7,2/10 \n\nSource: Retail DVD\nFormat: Xvid\nAspect ratio: 16x9\nSubs: SWE\nNo. of CD's: 2\nttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277027/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5020f0a9972eab1cdc0f0f06ce7444d1ec261dd5","amp;dn":"I.am.Sam.Xvid.sweSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5020f0a9972eab1cdc0f0f06ce7444d1ec261dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,32,240,169,151,46,171,28,220,15,15,6,206,116,68,209,236,38,29,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
