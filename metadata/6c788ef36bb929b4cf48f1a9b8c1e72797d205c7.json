Bandai and Sony Computer Entertainment have unveiled to Japanese retailers plans for two new anime titles, one based off Gundam and the other based of Bleach.\n\n\nBandai is developing Gundam Battle Tactics for the system. Although we haven't heard anything aside from the title, we can speculate that the game will offer strategy-based gameplay. As announced a couple of weeks back, Bandai is also bringing a port of Giren's Revenge to the system.\nSony Computer Entertainment will be releasing Bleach: Beat the Soul 2 for the system. The original Beat the Soul was developed by Japanese development house Eighting as the PSP's first fighting game. It suffered from a lack of characters and some of the worst load times on the system. We hope things improve for the sequel.\n\nMore details will be revealed on both titles in early July. Stay tuned!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c788ef36bb929b4cf48f1a9b8c1e72797d205c7","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DBLEACH+2+%5BJAP%5D%5BBY+ERICOO%5D.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c788ef36bb929b4cf48f1a9b8c1e72797d205c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,120,142,243,107,185,41,180,207,72,241,169,184,193,231,39,151,210,5,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
