They were unstoppable in the early eighties, with Fire Down Under still regarded as a classic, and one of the best metal albums of the eighties. Their initial run ended soon after 1983&amp;#039;s Born In America, but guitarist Mark Reale was undaunted, moving to Texas and starting up a new version of the band. Now many lineup changes removed from that incarnation, Riot continues to thrive, enjoy successing in Europe and Japan. Though they haven&amp;#039;t recorded since 2002, they are still an active entity and in fact a new album has been completed, though without a title or a release date. \n\n\nFire Down Under\n\t\n1981 Elektra\n\tBNR and Internet Top Ten Album\n\n   1.
