Let's call it 1.2\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUnzip mythtv_0.18.1_xebian_1.1.4_xbox.zip into E:debian on your xbox. You will probably need to edit your dashboard config file to add this directory to your menu. See your dashboard documentation for details.\n\nYou will need to login from another machine using ssh. The IP address is configured to be 192.168.1.6. There are a few logins that are default for this dist:\n\nLogin   Pass\n==============\nroot    xebian\nlive    live\n\nOnce you are able to boot into linux, ssh into the box using the live account. Make any changes necessary.\n\nChanges you are likely to make include:\n=======================================\nChanging the IP Address by editing /etc/network/interfaces.\nEditing /etc/hosts to change the mythtv entry to point to your backend.\nEditing /etc/fstab to nfs mount the media directory from your backend.\n\nNotes\n========\nCurrently MythTV is configured to point to a backend with the hostname 'mythtv' as defined in /etc/hosts. It currently points to 192.168.1.8.\n\nThis installation is also configured to mount mythtv:/mythtv on /mythtv.\n\nYou will also need to add permissions to your backend database so that this installation can access the database. I will not document that here. See www.mythtv.org for details.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n1.1 - Initial release. Torrent file does not specify versions.\n1.2 - xir.o and xpad.o kernel modules have been patched so that aftermarket (non-M$) remote will work. Much thanks to Vladan Bato for the fix.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nRob Anderson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:471e91215df83758cc428d0183fbaae28ec5cd9b","amp;dn":"mythtv_0.18.1_xebian_1.1.4_xbox_1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"471e91215df83758cc428d0183fbaae28ec5cd9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,30,145,33,93,248,55,88,204,66,141,1,131,251,170,226,142,197,205,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
