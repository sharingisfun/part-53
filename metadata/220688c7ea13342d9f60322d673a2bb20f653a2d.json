Worked for me which is good considering nothing else has.\n\nHave yet to try it myself. But I have received feedback that it works!\n\nEnjoy! \n\nBy the way this is my first upload","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:220688c7ea13342d9f60322d673a2bb20f653a2d","amp;dn":"Championship+Manager+5+-+Real+Eidos+Software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"220688c7ea13342d9f60322d673a2bb20f653a2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,6,136,199,234,19,52,45,159,96,50,45,103,58,43,178,15,101,58,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
