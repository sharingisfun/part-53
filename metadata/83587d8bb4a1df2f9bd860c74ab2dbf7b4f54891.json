Citywide blackouts... stock exchange sabotage... electronic hijacking of national defense systems... this is information warfare, which has become the most dangerous threat to global stability. To prevent these attacks, you must infiltrate deep into hostile territory and aggressively collect critical intelligence, closer than ever to enemy soldiers. You are Sam Fisher, the NSA's most elite black-ops agent. To achieve your mission you will operate undetected, kill at close-range, attack with your combat knife, shoot with the modular SC20K rifle, and use radical suppression techniques such as the inverted neck break. Work alone, or enjoy the thrill of cooperative multiplayer infiltration missions, where teamwork is the ultimate weapon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83587d8bb4a1df2f9bd860c74ab2dbf7b4f54891","amp;dn":"Tom+Clancys+Splinter+Cell+Chaos+Theory+%5BPS2%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BMULTI5+ENG-SPA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83587d8bb4a1df2f9bd860c74ab2dbf7b4f54891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,88,125,139,180,161,223,47,155,216,96,199,74,178,219,247,180,245,72,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
