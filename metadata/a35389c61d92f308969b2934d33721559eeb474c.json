Keith Richards is especially cool during this era, and many would agree that the band is pretty much at their peak here. Great rock and roll music, originally released in quadrophonic sound. Recorded live in Texas, with all on-stage footage and no backstage or interview shots whatsoever. The biggest problem is that you CAN'T BUY THE THING!!! Why has this never been released officially on VHS? Where's a new remastered DVD? Most likely Allen Klein is to blame somehow for this great footage not being (legitimately) available, but let's hope that someday we can actually go buy an official release of this classic. Stones fans HAVE to see this thing, but casual fans may want to stick with &amp;quot;Gimme Shelter,&amp;quot; which you can at least go buy/rent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a35389c61d92f308969b2934d33721559eeb474c","amp;dn":"Ladies+and+Gentlemen%3A+The+Rolling+Stones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a35389c61d92f308969b2934d33721559eeb474c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,83,137,198,29,146,243,8,150,155,41,52,211,55,33,85,158,235,71,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
