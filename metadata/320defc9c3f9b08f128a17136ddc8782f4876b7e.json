After being shot at by military guards, Klaatu is brought to a Washington, D.C. hospital, where he begs a sympathetic but frank Major White (Robert Osterloh) to gather all the worldÃ‚Â´s leaders so he can tell them more specifically what he has come to warn them about. Losing patience, Klaatu slips into the human world, adapting a false identity and living at a boarding house where he meets a smart woman with a conscience and her inquisitive son. Both mother and son soon find themselves embroiled in the complex mystery of Klaatu, his message and the governmentÃ‚Â´s witch hunt for the alien.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:320defc9c3f9b08f128a17136ddc8782f4876b7e","amp;dn":"The+Day+the+Earth+Stood+Still+Full+Dvd+Spa-Eng-Ger-Fre-Ita+Pal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"320defc9c3f9b08f128a17136ddc8782f4876b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,13,239,201,195,249,176,143,18,138,23,19,109,220,135,130,244,135,107,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
