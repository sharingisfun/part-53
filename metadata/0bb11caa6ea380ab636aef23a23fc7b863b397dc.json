There he meets the lovely Nina, who is communing with her late husband. The two are penniless--she works in a local bar that is about to close down, while he has been forced to start selling his meager possessions. All seems hopelessly bleak, yet as Hamo begins to court Nina, their unexpected union revitalizes them.\n\nDirected by: Hiner Saleem\n\nCredited cast:\nRomen Avinian\t.... \tHamo\nLala Sarkissian\t.... \tNina\nIvan Franek\t.... \tDilovan\nRuzan Mesropyan\t.... \tZine\nZahal Karielachvili\t.... \tGiano\nArmen Marutyan\t\t\nAstrik Avaguian\n\nIs a DVD5 , PAL\n\nLanguajes : Spanish , Armenian\nSubtitles:  Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb11caa6ea380ab636aef23a23fc7b863b397dc","amp;dn":"VODKA+LEMON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb11caa6ea380ab636aef23a23fc7b863b397dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,177,28,170,110,163,128,171,99,106,239,35,162,63,199,184,99,179,151,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
