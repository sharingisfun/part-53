I also really started to use BitTorrent, a lovely (if perhaps somewhat ethically challenged) piece of technology.  There is so much music out there, and the whole thing is a lot like we did when we borrowed our friends LPs to tape them.\n\nSo, there I was looking at things, pulling in old ? and I do mean OLD ? songs.  Once, I heard a set on KRMA, back when it was still the station for the graduate department at DU, it was an intermixture of Scruggs and Flatts hard pickin? bluegrass with Bach sonatas.  So, I went for something similar.  \n\nNote - the rtf file enclosed is intended to be printed as a booklet on a duplex laser printer.\n\nAnd so, a full cup be yours, and enjoy these Contrasts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa7d1f3008e8967f77c7e0b074a84580ddea3b9c","amp;dn":"Contrasts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa7d1f3008e8967f77c7e0b074a84580ddea3b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,125,31,48,8,232,150,127,119,199,224,176,116,168,69,128,221,234,59,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
