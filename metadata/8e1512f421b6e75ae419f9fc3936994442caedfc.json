Within seconds of its commencement, this music        has plunged you far beyond your world. Deep into        space, past Pluto and into mysterious interstellar        realms. Here, the melodies tease the quantum        particles with their surging sequences, agitating the        molecules into dark motion.        This tuneage is seething with numerous pulsations        and bass tonalities. The harmonics may be        keyboard-driven, but they swarm in a nebula of        beyond-ambient electronics that are not unlike the        gestation of a proto-star. Chords and cycles are        drawn into the central melody to orbit with        increasing pace. This action produces riffs of a        dynamic quality, paying homage to the more deadly        elements of the void.        Intimating the promise of an alien threat from        outside your world, Kubusschnitt generates        electronic music that excites the listener&amp;#039;s thrill        factor. Whether plunging into a &quot;Wormhole&quot; or        blotting out the sky with a &quot;Hypercube&quot;, these        compositions appeal to the audience&amp;#039;s rhythmic        sensibilities as well as the listener&amp;#039;s dark side.        This music acts like a subspace wake-up call for        the psyche, tickling the brain with its insistent pace        and smoldering density.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1512f421b6e75ae419f9fc3936994442caedfc","amp;dn":"Kubusschnitt+-+The+Cube+%5BE-Newage%2C+2000%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1512f421b6e75ae419f9fc3936994442caedfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,21,18,244,33,182,231,90,228,25,249,252,57,54,153,68,66,202,237,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
