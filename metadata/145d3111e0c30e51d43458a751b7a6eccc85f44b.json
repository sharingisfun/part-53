Problems with the Windows Registry are a common cause of Windows crashes and error messages. By using PC tune-up utilities such as registry cleaners regularly, your system will be more stable, your software will run quicker, and your operating system will boot faster. Registry problems can occur for many reasons, including references left behind after uninstallation; incorrect removal of software; missing or corrupt hardware drivers; or orphaned start-up programs. With a few easy steps, Registry Mechanic will scan your entire registry for any invalid entries and provide a list of the errors found. You then can choose to clean each item or automatically repair them all after making a backup without the need for a registry editor such as Regedit. PC Tools products are free of spyware and adware.\n\nVersion 5.0 improves scanning speed and problem detection, includes a customizable ignore list for selective scan, and features an online Live Update facility.\n\nenjoy\n\niGGiBud\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145d3111e0c30e51d43458a751b7a6eccc85f44b","amp;dn":"reistry+mechanic+5.1+released+december+10th2005+including+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145d3111e0c30e51d43458a751b7a6eccc85f44b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,93,49,17,224,195,14,81,212,52,88,167,81,183,166,236,204,133,244,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
