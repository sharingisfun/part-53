We&amp;#039;ve located and fixed some bugs in the original and CVS code (as well as our own), and added a host of new features and improvements, as well as externalizing key bits of data to xml.\n\n1.13 is really more of an upgrade to the base game engine than a total conversion. So while we&amp;#039;ve added new resolutions, improved AI, weather effects and new items, we have left the original maps and quests intact. 1.13 has been structured in such a way that it can be used as a baseline for creating new mods.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you read the entire readme before installing 1.13, as it makes significant changes to the game!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccdf8831471eb36188d400f2c11c569d1f3e6f97","amp;dn":"Jagged+Alliance+2+v1.13+mod+%2B+English+.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccdf8831471eb36188d400f2c11c569d1f3e6f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,223,136,49,71,30,179,97,136,212,0,242,193,28,86,157,31,62,111,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
