'Crows fly in flocks, the eagle soars alone', but tenants drive a wedge in his solitude. Movie about human relations, frailty and illusions. To my taste Lancaster's best role, Berger's too. Mangano's splendid, as usual. The 'interno' is a visual feast, as we'd come to expect from Visconti.\n\nXvid, PAL, 704 x 304\nAudio AC3 192 kbps 2 ch (96/ch) 48000 Hz\n\nEncoded with AutoGK, my first attempt. Plays well on my computer and standalone player. Any problem, let me know please. Initial seeding could be slow, connection's funny at times.
