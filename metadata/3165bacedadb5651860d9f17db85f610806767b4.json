He's being chased by a police psychologist, two cops and an investigative reporter who all seem to have dark little secrets of their own.\n\nThe film comes to a dramatic and violent conclusion, so take someone with you it your easily scared.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3165bacedadb5651860d9f17db85f610806767b4","amp;dn":"Freeze.Frame.LiMiTED.DVDrip.XVID-ALLiANCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3165bacedadb5651860d9f17db85f610806767b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,101,186,206,218,219,86,81,134,13,159,23,219,133,246,16,128,103,103,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
