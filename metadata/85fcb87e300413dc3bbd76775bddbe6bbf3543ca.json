This 7z archive contains two sets bin/cue files. the SB_INSTALL set is the base drivers plus the Creative software package. The SB_INSTALL_EAX is the EAX 4.0 Advanced HD Driver.\n\nI'm providing ISOs for the CDs because from what I understand, in order to install the drivers from Creative's website, the original drivers from the CD need to be installed first. That, and a friend of mine requested for these so here you go!\n\nIn order to extract the .7z archive, you will need to download 7-zip here: http://www.7-zip.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fcb87e300413dc3bbd76775bddbe6bbf3543ca","amp;dn":"Sound+Blaster+Audigy+2+ZS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85fcb87e300413dc3bbd76775bddbe6bbf3543ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,252,184,126,48,4,19,220,59,189,118,119,91,221,190,107,191,53,67,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
