Professor Stephen Turner leads students to believe that they are applying increasingly painful electric shocks to other subjects when they fail to perform a task correctly, and is alarmed to see how much pain the students can be convinced to inflict &quot;in the name of science.&quot;\n\nThis 1975 William Shatner made for TV movie was broadcast only a few times on CBS. Despite being based on actual events, it was considered too unrealisitic and disturbing. CBS shelved the movie and it was never released on video. This recording is a VHS copy that was recorded with DVD recorder so the quality will be poor. However, because it was never released on video you aren&amp;#039;t likely to find this anywhere else or a better quality copy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfffef952d59e80aff0a668ac5def5a3b9d969ff","amp;dn":"The+Tenth+Level","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfffef952d59e80aff0a668ac5def5a3b9d969ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,255,239,149,45,89,232,10,255,10,102,138,197,222,245,163,185,217,105,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
