Watch the dancing flowers rock out to the song Jam J. Learn form the song Honest Joe when juxtaposed to Satan damming the lost souls. Sit back in awe as we watch Cupid's spread love throughout Mount Olympus, followed by the crescendo of Zeus unleashing a storm, and the restored tranquility after the storm.\n\nFantasia's extraordinary animation lends itself to being remixed with the chaotic and exotic music of Wah Wah. While the music was never altered or edited, the picture has been re-cut to precisely fit the new score.\n\nWorks with the Video iPod and Apple iTunes, Quicktime 7 etc. \nMore info: www.reduxfilms.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea27148ef84ff2185c0572d57acf3466c3619d9","amp;dn":"Fantasia+In+Dub+-+iPod+Video+-+Music+by+James+-+Animation+by+Dis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea27148ef84ff2185c0572d57acf3466c3619d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,162,113,72,239,132,255,33,133,192,87,45,87,172,243,70,108,54,25,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
