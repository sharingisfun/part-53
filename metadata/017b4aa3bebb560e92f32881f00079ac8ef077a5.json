The iso is inside....\nGo to [COLOR=orange]www.iso-tek.org[/COLOR] for support but, READ ME FIRST!\nThis compilation DVD will install windows automatically after you tell it where to install to. DO NOT upgrade....DO NOT install over another windows install.\n\n\n[SIZE=7]!!!!!!!!!!!YOU MUST FORMAT AND DO A FRESH INSTALL!!!!!!!!![/SIZE]\n\nUpon initiating a fresh, clean install, windows will not ask for a serial, or activation, or registration! If it does...your doing it wrong! SEE Above!\nAfter windows completes installation and after first reboot, the WPI Borg menu will appear for 120 seconds for you to choose your own programs.\nWhen you click the install button, everything you selected will be silently installed - no user interaction is required.\nIf you do not click anywhere on the menu screen before 120 seconds has elapsed, a default selection of about 30 apps will install automatically.\n The serial and cracks folder has been updated as well so, if your chosen app is not &quot; cracked&quot; then go there and get the appropriate can opener.\nAny cracks with an NFO file - use the notepad and READ IT! Any cracksserials that I missed......Humor me - go and find them yourself!\n\nIf you get blue screen or freezes - then you may not be able to use this DVD....I tried to make it as compatible as possible\nfor as many machines as I could but, I can't include drivers for every configuration or I would not have any space left for any apps!\nThere are over 10,000 drivers or more for various manufacturers out there so I expect a few problems in that area.....Every other Borg edition worked quite well \nfor the magority of people but........I don't appreciate whiners whose comps fall through the cracks - live with it!\n\nConsists of:\nWindows XP Corp SP 2 Final\n\nDrivers:\nOver 1000 drivers for LAN, Sound, Mass Storage, Wireless Lan and Graphics included\n\nAudioVideo Applications:\nMicrosoft Windows Media Player 10.0 \nPower DVD 6.0\nIntervideo Win DVD 7.0 Premium\nK-Lite Codec Pack 2.63\nBS Player Pro 1.37\nMacromedia Shockwave/Flash Players 8.0\nNVIDIA Sound Control Panel (if required)\nWinAmp 5.092\n\nCD\\DVD Applications:\nAlcohol 120% 3105\nCloneCD 5.2.51\nCloneDVD 2.8.4.1\nAnyDVD 4.5.5.1\nDVD Shrink 3.2.0.15\nDVD Santa 4.0\nDVD Decrypter 3.5.4.0\nNero 6.6 - 7.0 is a waste of space\nNero Mega Plug in Pack\nUltraIso 7.6.5.1225\nOpen Video Joiner 3.0.0\n\nGraphics:\nAdobe Photoshop CS2\nSnagit 7.2.1\nIrfanview 3.97\nPhotoFiltre\n\nInternet:\nABC Bittorrent Client 3.1\nAzureus 2.3.0.6\nBurst! 3.1b Bittorrent Client\nMSN Messenger 7.5 w Plus\nMozilla FireFox 1.5\nMozilla Thunderbird 1.07\nOpera Web Browser 8.0\nFlashget 1.71 Final\nLimeWire Pro 4.8.1\nCute FTP Pro 7.0\nUltraFXP 1.07\nWsFtp Pro 8.0\nTight VNC 1.2.9\nE-Mule Plus 0.46c\nFileZilla 2.2.17a\nSkype 1.4\nTrillian Pro 3.1\n\nOffice:\nOffice 2003 SP 1\nFront Page 2003 SP 1\nAdobe Acrobat Pro 7.0 Full\nMicrosoft ActiveSync 4.1\nPageBreeze 3.0b\n123 Renamer\nAdobe Acrobat Pro 7.0\nFoxit PDF Reader\nMicrosoft Reader 2.1.1\n\nSecurity:\nAvast Professional 4.6.731\nAVG Anti-Virus 7.1\nKaspersky Anti-Virus 5.0.388\nSymantec Anti-Virus 10.0 Corporate\nXoftSpy 4.19.131\nSygate Personal Firewall 5.6.331\nKerio Personal Firewall 4.2.2\nOutpost Agnitum Firewall Pro 2.7\nNoadware Spyware Remover 4.0\nAd-Aware Pro SE 1.06\nZone Alarm Pro 6.1.737\n\nSystem:\nDot Net Framework 2.0\nMicrosoft Java VM Build 3809\nSun Java 2 V5.0.6 W/SP2\nDiskeeper 10.0 Pro\nVopt Defragger 7.22\n\nUtilities:\nDesktop Side Bar 1.04.88\nGmail Desktop Notifier\nCrapCleaner 1.26\nStat Bar 2.406\n7-Zip 4.31\nTweaknow Powerpack 2006\nTune Up Utilities 2006\nWinRar 3.51\nWinZip Professional v10.0\nRegistry Workshop 2.5.0\nRegSupreme Pro 1.2\nRegistry Mechanic 5.0\nISScript 10.0\nCPU-Z\nGameXP\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017b4aa3bebb560e92f32881f00079ac8ef077a5","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Borg+Edition+V5.0+Final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017b4aa3bebb560e92f32881f00079ac8ef077a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,123,74,163,190,187,86,14,146,243,40,129,240,0,121,172,142,240,119,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
