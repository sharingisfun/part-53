The X&amp;#039;s and O&amp;#039;s show for hard-core NFL fans, hosted by Sal Paolantonio with analysis from Ron Jaworski and Merril Hoge.\n\nThe first episode is the Super Bowl edition, breaking down the X&amp;#039;s and O&amp;#039;s of the Super Bowl matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe second episode is from a month ago, breaking down the matchups of Week 17.  It is by far the best episode this whole season.  I learned a TON watching that show.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re a NFL fan outside of America and havent seen this before, I HIGHLY recommend checking this out.  Download now and thank me later! :)\n\n\nP.S. There&amp;#039;ll be a post-Super Bowl recap episode next week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c86544fbf00566da124dce1520e68a39e7ad401","amp;dn":"ESPN.EA.Sports.NFL.Match.Up.Show.Super.Bowl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c86544fbf00566da124dce1520e68a39e7ad401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,134,84,79,191,0,86,109,161,36,220,225,82,14,104,163,158,122,212,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
