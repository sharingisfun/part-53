Now add two cups of tomatoe juice, turtle crap and two homosexual bats. Turn it on, watch all these things mix together, for about 10 minutes. Get bored of watching after only 5 minutes and open the blender, pour the mix into your toilet and flush it!\n\nLandmine Spring is...uh a band with very loud guitars (how original) and obviously no good ideas to present. Only a few here and there riffs save the whole situation. The vocals are Hardcore but not the ones you can?t find anywhere else. 9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb90ee7b5ea392864a0cc5a3c8569e3767b06fdc","amp;dn":"Landmine+Spring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb90ee7b5ea392864a0cc5a3c8569e3767b06fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,144,238,123,94,163,146,134,74,12,197,163,200,86,158,55,103,176,111,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
