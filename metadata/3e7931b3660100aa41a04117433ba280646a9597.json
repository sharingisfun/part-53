Gentry borrows from all to form his own unique sound.\n\nGentry blends the angst of youthful years and lost loves with optimism for a better tomorrow. His acoustic stylings reach into the soul and speak to the hearts of anyone who has ever lost a love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7931b3660100aa41a04117433ba280646a9597","amp;dn":"Gentry+Morris+-+Daydreams+%5B2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7931b3660100aa41a04117433ba280646a9597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,121,49,179,102,1,0,170,65,160,65,23,67,59,162,128,100,106,149,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
