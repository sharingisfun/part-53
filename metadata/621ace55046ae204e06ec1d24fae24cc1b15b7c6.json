CITY BOY, with their trademark twin lead vocal style of Lol Mason and Steve Broughton, dabbled with Progressive Rock, Funk Rock and radio friendly rockers. Many of CITY BOY's album were notably produced by produced by Robert John 'Mutt' Lange.\n\nThe group's foundations lay in the early seventies club act BACK IN THE BAND, comprising Lol Mason, Steve Broughton, Chris Dunn, Max Thomas and drummer Roger Kent. With the addition of guitarist Mike Slamer the band evolved out of the acoustic scene and became CITY BOY. The band signed to the Vertigo label and debuted in 1976 with the single 'Hap-Ki-Do', this track charting in the UK in the lower reaches of the top 40.\n\nThe 1978 album 'Book Early' was the first to feature new drummer Roy Ward. It would be launched in fine style with the hit single '5.7.0.5', originally entitled 'Turn On To Jesus' but re-named at the insistence of the record label. That year CITY BOY undertook high profile touring of North America as support to HALL &amp; OATES. 1979's 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire', once again produced by Lange, would be recorded in the exotic climes of Compass Point Studios, Nassau in the Bahamas. Although the group had switched to Atlantic Records for the US market the onslaught of Punk Rock suffocated any further progress. The band's last live date would be in 1979 and the 1980 album 'Heads Are rolling' would be released with negligible promotion. Following 1981's 'It's Personal', only released in Scandinavia, the band folded.\n\nLol Mason joined THE MAISONETTES, issuing a 1983 album 'Maisonettes For Sale'. Steve Broughton would re-emerge as a songwriter for Pop diva CYNDI LAUPER. Guitarist Mike Slamer would go on to form the highly rated STREETS AOR act with KANSAS vocalist STEVE WALSH. After streets he founded STEELHOUSE LANE. Slamer featured on a whole crop of eighties Hard Rock outings both as session player and composer. As guitarist he would feature on both FIONA's 'Heart Like A Gun' and 'Beyond The Pale' albums. He would make his presence felt on JAMES CHRISTIAN's 'Rude Awakening' outing, acting as producer and musician. His track 'Dr. Love' is included on the HARDLINE album 'Double Eclipse' and songwriting credits grace HOUSE OF LORDS epic 'Demons Down' record. Although never publiclly acknowledged, it is generally thought that Slamer donated all the guitar solos to WARRANT's 'Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich' album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:621ace55046ae204e06ec1d24fae24cc1b15b7c6","amp;dn":"City+Boy+-+Heads+Are+Rolling+-+1980","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"621ace55046ae204e06ec1d24fae24cc1b15b7c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,26,206,85,4,106,226,4,224,110,193,210,79,174,36,204,27,21,183,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
