Right, one with 4 engines and if possible one \n\nthat is small enough to park on a small airport. Now AEROSOFT brings the aircraft that is in a \n\nclass of it&amp;#039;s own. The BAe 146, aka Jumbolino.\n\nFully updated from it&amp;#039;s FS2002 version by the team that brought you EuroWings, this regional \n\njet airliner made in the UK was designed to meet the demanding requirements of the regional \n\nair transport market where heavy utilisation on short flight coupled with high reliability are the \n\nmost important requirements. Outstanding airfield performance (very short take-off and landing \n\nand high manoeuvrability) and very low noise levels are other attributes of the aircraft, which \n\nmade it a money making machine for many airlines all over the world.\n\nPowered by four 30.0kN (6700lb) Textron Lycoming ALF 502R3s or four 31.0kN (6970lb) ALF \n\n502R5 turbofans, this small aircraft has impressive performance. Cruising speed 767km/h \n\n(414kt), long range cruising speed 669km/h (361kt). Range with standard fuel 3000km \n\n(1620nm), range with max payload 1630km (880nm).\n\nIn two versions (200 and 300), and 36 (!) of liveries (see the list) this product will make you \n\nlong for short runways, complex approaches and moderate weather.
