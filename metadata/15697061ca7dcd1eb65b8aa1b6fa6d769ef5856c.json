Under Image file information, it should list the two files. Click &quot;Next&quot;\n4. If you didn&amp;#039;t insert a high quality CD-R earlier, insert it and set the write speed at the slowest one (mine was 4x). Make sure the CD/DVD Recorder is set on the right drive.\n5. Click &quot;Start&quot; and it should start burning. Once it reaches 100%, it&amp;#039;ll be done and the disc will eject on its own. \n- Once the disk is ready, follow these steps\n1. Go to your vehicle and turn the ignition switch to the first position. Let the navigation system boot up and get into a normal operating mode.\n2. Leaving the system on (never turn the power off during these steps!!), go back and eject the navigation CD from your drive unit.\n3. Put in the V27 disk you created into your drive unit. Watch your screen and be patient. It says it will take about 6 minutes to do the upgrade, but it doesn&amp;#039;t take that long. When it?s done it will eject the CD automatically. \n4. Put your navigation CD back in the drive and make sure everything is working properly.\n\nTo activate the Perspective view mode with V27 you need to do the following (thanks to 2Wires for this info):\nGo to the main menu and then settings. Press the menu button for about 10 seconds until a new menu appears.\nCheck &quot;Perspective&quot;. VoilÃƒÂ¡. Perspective mode is now available.\n\nVisit www.x5world.com and www.m3forum.com!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15697061ca7dcd1eb65b8aa1b6fa6d769ef5856c","amp;dn":"BMW+Mark+IV+v27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15697061ca7dcd1eb65b8aa1b6fa6d769ef5856c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,105,112,97,202,125,205,30,182,91,138,161,182,250,109,118,158,245,133,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
