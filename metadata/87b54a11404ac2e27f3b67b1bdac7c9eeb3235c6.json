He then takes the Deputy Headmistress back to his home in LA and as his date for the American Music Awards. While he's away the band struggles to write and learn a song, and chaos breaks out as they turn on the lead singer for failing to sing in tune and on beat. Gene returns to announce that their first gig singing &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is to be in front of the children's parents in the school theatre.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b54a11404ac2e27f3b67b1bdac7c9eeb3235c6","amp;dn":"Gene+Simmons+Rock+School+-+S01E04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b54a11404ac2e27f3b67b1bdac7c9eeb3235c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,181,74,17,64,74,194,226,127,59,103,177,189,172,124,158,235,50,53,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
