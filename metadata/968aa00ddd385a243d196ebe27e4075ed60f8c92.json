I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named &quot;b2pilot187&quot;. Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be solved sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nSynopsis:\n\nBush administration Labor Dept. economist, Dr. Morgan Reynolds, and Eric Hufschmid, author of &quot;Painful Questions&quot;, spell out clearly the evidence proving 9-11 was done by the U.S. government and agents from Israel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:968aa00ddd385a243d196ebe27e4075ed60f8c92","amp;dn":"911+-+Morgan+Reynolds+and+Eric+Hufschmid+on+key+9-11+evidence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"968aa00ddd385a243d196ebe27e4075ed60f8c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,138,160,13,221,56,90,36,61,25,110,190,39,228,7,94,214,15,140,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
