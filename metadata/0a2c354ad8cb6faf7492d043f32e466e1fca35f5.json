This was one of a series of minimal re-recordings completed by DM during the _Playing the Angel_ sessions. On the DVD, the track appears as a black&amp;white video culled from random studio footage and actual footage of the recording itself. \n\nIt's teh hot and frankly the only worthwhile thing on the CD, so spare yourself the 4GB dowbload and jsut get the good stuff.\n\nEncoding is OK, done with DVDxDV Pro, to 320x240 Quicktime. The audio quality is more than acceptable. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2c354ad8cb6faf7492d043f32e466e1fca35f5","amp;dn":"clean_bare_med.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2c354ad8cb6faf7492d043f32e466e1fca35f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,44,53,74,216,203,111,175,116,146,208,67,243,46,70,110,31,202,53,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
