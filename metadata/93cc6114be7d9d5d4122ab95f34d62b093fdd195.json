Turn your navigation device into a portable media and entertainment centre. Movies, recorded TV and any other video can be converted and watched on the TomTom GO, in great quality, in full screen, with excellent sound. A memorycard as small as 128 Mb is enough to store a couple episodes of a tv-series, a full length feature film, or a hundred minutes of your home movies. Let your children watch their favourite TV-cartoons in the car or watch a blockbuster movie while travelling for business. \n\nThe software installs an encoding package on a  Windows XP computer, users pick a video file from their harddrive, CD or DVD and with only two clicks, the software turns it into a very small movie file, which will play on the Makayama video player on the TomTom. Subtitled and foreign language DVDs are also supported.  \n\nSoftware runs on: Windows XP/2000/NT/Vista and the following TomTom models: TOMTOM GO, GO 300, GO 500, GO 700 (TomTom One and Rider will be supported later).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93cc6114be7d9d5d4122ab95f34d62b093fdd195","amp;dn":"Media+Studio+fot+Tom+Tom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93cc6114be7d9d5d4122ab95f34d62b093fdd195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,204,97,20,190,125,157,93,65,34,171,149,243,77,98,176,147,253,209,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
