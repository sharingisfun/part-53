Extra features or changes in the game\n\nThe Assassins are invisible to your enemies and can only be seen when they have been spotted by the enemy?s troops.  An ?!? will appear above the assassins heads to show you they have been seen.\n\nWhen playing a multiplayer game the host will be shown with a star next to their name.\n\nYou can trade commodities with your allies.  To do this, go to the allies screen then into the send or request goods section (click on the talk to allies button).\n\nWithin the send or request goods screen, click on a good type (i.e. wood) then click on the amount buttons along the bottom to specify the quantity you wish to send or receive.  You can clear this amount, by pressing the thumbs down icon.\n\nThe sound options include an additional option, which is Genie speech.  This will turn off general Genie speech in the game, such as the greatest lord speech, as well as the Scribe?s game paused and game running speech.\n \nThe multiplayer host screen includes some extra play options.  These are:\n?No cow throwing? ? Cows cannot be launched from trebuchets or catapults.\n?No dogs? ? Caged war dogs cannot be used. \n?No rush? ? This option allows for a timed amount of peacetime before any players can attack each other or build troops.\n\nWith the custom scenario editor you can create castle builder, crusader and custom scenario maps.  Custom scenario maps allow you to create either an economic or invasion map type with their own set of events.\n\nSkirmish masters screen ? This screen lists the maps you have played in either a Crusader custom game or the Crusader trail. You can sort the names by score, name, amount of time played or date.  You can also click on the map name and view further information about it.   Right clicking on the map name allows you to delete it.  The scores are saved out to the skmasters.dat file.  You can have up to 250 games displayed on this screen.\n\nLord Strengths ? Different computer Lords have different strengths.  This is shown by the colored dots above the Lords? heads.  The blue dots are shown for a stronger opponent and the yellow dots are displayed for a weaker one.  They can have as many as five dots over their heads.  A player?s Lord has an average strength so no dots are displayed.\n\n5. Setting Up Your Identity\n\nYou can choose which type of Lord you wish to play within game.  You can choose from either a Crusader Lord or Arabic Lord.  This does not affect which units you can build but the Lord type will affect your starting troops.\n\nYou also choose from the portrait you wish to show when you hover over the mouse over sections of your castle (this picture will also be shown to other users in the full games, multiplayer mode).  You can create your own portrait, if you load the faces.bmp (located in the root of the game folder) file into a paint package.  You will notice we have left two free slots for your own portrait. The size for this portrait should be 64 x 64 pixels.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543fbbb41ed0b6f4256fe428056da2b73608e3f8","amp;dn":"StrongHold+Crusader+%28rip%29%21%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543fbbb41ed0b6f4256fe428056da2b73608e3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,63,187,180,30,208,182,244,37,111,228,40,5,109,162,183,54,8,227,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
