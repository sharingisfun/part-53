John Gregson stars as the dour lawyer Alan who, baited by his larger than life friend (Kenneth More), accepts a bet on who will return to London first.\n\nDinah Sheridan and Fay Kendal provide glamorous and dependable support, with Kendal sparkling as an upper class fashion model with an unexpected capacity for trumpet playing and heavy drinking. Much of the film is typical race and chase stuff, but avoids the usual potholes of over-engineered stunts and tricks. The characters are far more interesting than that!\n\nA brilliant harmonica soundtrack by Larry Adler keeps the tempo and spirits high and the full colour production provides a ready backdrop of 1950&amp;#039;s town and country scenes. Escapist entertainment from a period when British cinema boomed.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa39c71f98d1e7fa3241d05f2a7ca834fc3837dc","amp;dn":"Genevieve+1953","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa39c71f98d1e7fa3241d05f2a7ca834fc3837dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,57,199,31,152,209,231,250,50,65,208,95,42,124,168,52,252,56,55,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
