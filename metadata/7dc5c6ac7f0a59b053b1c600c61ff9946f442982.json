If you prefear you can flash this     ?\n ?     BIOS from DVD if you have Cobra 0.3+ already running on your chip.   ?\n ?     We've heard Viper Team will release an USB programmer for the chip   ?\n ?     soon if you prefear USB.                                             ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?   - Turn on your GC with the disc you want to run. It can be an          ? \n ?     original or a backup, but if it's a backup it should be filled with  ? \n ?     1.3GB of data at least (for now). If you have a black screen coming, ?\n ?     it's probably beause your Viper installation is not clean.           ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?   - While turning on your GC:                                            ?\n ?        - Hold Y to go to Main Menu (if it's not your Default Boot mode)  ?\n ?        - Hold X for the other boot mode (can be set in Config Menu)      ?\n ?        - Don't hold anything for Default Boot Action                     ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?   - Select &amp;quot;Direct Disc Boot&amp;quot; if you want to play a backup or homebrew   ?\n ?     program from DVD. If you have problems using the Direct Disc Boot    ? \n ?     method with your media, you can still use the Swap trick.            ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?   - If you want to use the old Swap Trick Method (for discs that are     ?\n ?     not full or that have problems to sync with the Direct Disc Boot)    ?\n ?     boot your GC with an original disc. Then choose the &amp;quot;Change Disc&amp;quot;    ?\n ?     option and follow the instructions. After the swap is done, you      ?\n ?     can select Direct Disc Boot option again.                            ? \n ?                                                                          ?\n ?   - Select &amp;quot;Original BIOS&amp;quot; if you want to play an original Game          ?\n ?     compatible with your GC region, or if you want to go into the        ?\n ?     Original BIOS menus.                                                 ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?   - Select &amp;quot;Configuration Menu&amp;quot; if you want to change your Cobra BIOS    ?\n ?     configuration.

The GC drive in its default state only eats high-quality DVD-R and      ?\n ?  a few MINI-DVD-R. But a couple of weeks ago, speedi from the afterdawn  ?\n ?  forums found a nice way to tweak the laser so it reads almost any burned?\n ?  media including some DVD+Rs. We recommend doing this laser tweak if you ?\n ?  have any problems reading your DVDs. We are no laser experts, in fact   ?\n ?  we think it would be more appropriate to just lower the value of the    ?\n ?  variable resistor instead of setting it to an absoulte given value,     ?\n ?  but lots of people including us have been using this laser tweek for a  ?\n ?  couple of weeks without any problem reported so far.                    ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  You don't need to encrypt the disc or use a special burner firmware     ?\n ?  to write the disc. Just burn your ISO/GCM (rename it to .ISO) with      ?\n ?  Nero (or any other tool).                                               ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?

If you want to use cheat codes, enter Cheat Codes menu,select a game,   ?\n ?  check the codes you want to use, exit the cheat selector and enable     ?\n ?  cheats.                                                                 ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  To add new codes follow on-screen instructions. The codes are           ?\n ?  compatible with decrypted AR codes. You can decrypt AR codes using      ?\n ?  the great GCNCrypt by Parayste. Never enter the first code of a given   ?\n ?  cheat code (validator code). You can also put .COD files on a DVD and   ?\n ?  load cheat codes from there, each file corresponds to one game.         ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  For now we've reserved 4kb in Viper GC Flash memory to store cheat      ?\n ?  codes. If that's not enough we'll add some more space in next release.  ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?

In direct boot mode the GC is very selective about the media it       ?\n ?    takes. If you have any problem please try the swap trick. If you      ?\n ?    still have problems try with different media/burner. Make sure your   ?\n ?    laser is correctly tweaked!                                           ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  - Audio Streaming: Some games use a special audio streaming mode        ?\n ?    that can be compared to CDDA. For now, the ISO of the file needs to   ?\n ?    be patched with 0rbital's great ViperTemporaryAudioFix 1.1+. If the   ?\n ?    ISO is not patched you'll have noise instead of music. We will try to ?\n ?    fix this issue so no patching is required. But in case we do, YOUR    ?\n ?    PATCHED ISOS WILL BE FULLY COMPATIBLE and still work with music!      ?\n ?    (so forget what is written in the fixer nfo file). Don't run the fix  ?\n ?    on ISOs that don't need fixing as it will only destroy them :-)       ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  - Most multi-discs games are working, just play with Disc 1 until       ?\n ?    you're asked to change disc and make a save here. Then boot with      ?\n ?    Disc 2 instead. We started working on code to allow disc-change,      ?\n ?    and we'll integrate it in a new release.                              ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  All those problems could be fixed in a next update.                     ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  Before burning an image, makes sure it is 1459978240 bytes long else    ?\n ?  you may need to use the swap trick method.                              ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  To know what's your GC Version code (2 digit number) go into Config     ?\n ?  Menu, then Version Info, 2nd page. First digit corresponds to GC        ?\n ?  mobo version, 2nd digit corresponds to drive version.                   ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  IF YOU MAKE BACKUPS, DON'T USE ANY &amp;quot;WIPE&amp;quot; TOOLS TO SAVE SPACE. Unless   ?\n ?  you know it's REALLY working. Most of thoses tools only work because    ?\n ?  the current pso loaders patch libraries routines to emulate DVD. But    ?\n ?  on REAL HARDWARE, each file/fst has to be aligned on a 4-byte boundary! ?\n ?  Else nothing will work. Audio Files (for audio streaming) even need     ?\n ?  to be aligned on a 32kb-boundary ! So forget current &amp;quot;WIPE&amp;quot; tools until ?\n ?  they are fixed. But note that Garbage is NOT NEEDED by the GC. The      ?\n ?  files must be correctly aligned that's it. So if your &amp;quot;WIPE&amp;quot; tool is    ?\n ?  not changing the image size (meaning there's no relocation) then it's   ?\n ?  probably fine. Use FSTFIX by LOONYCUBE to fix bad rips.                 ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?

We'll release a command-line MultiBoot Disc maker next week if nobody   ?\n ?  releases a better one before we do :-) Here are the specs for Multiboot ?\n ?  discs.

The MultiBoot feature is stealth for the GC so it's 100% compatible     ?\n ?  with homebrew images. If you want to put several backups on one disc    ?\n ?  you'll have to remove the garbage at first.                             ?\n ?

Lately there has been a few events we'd like to comment. First,         ?\n ?  congratulation to Utopia for the deobfuscation work you did and the     ?\n ?  release of Anaconda. We like your style :-) Except maybe for the        ?\n ?  &amp;quot;Mentalcube [...] did a well job while choosing the neccessary patches&amp;quot; ?\n ?  we find that &amp;quot;choosing&amp;quot; is not exactly the right term, as this patch    ?\n ?  is the results of tousands of lines of firmware code and several months ?\n ?  of hacking and debugging. And thanks for the obfuscation tips :-)       ?\n ?  Anaconda led to a lot of stuff from the best (GCOS) to the worst        ?\n ?  (people selling our code without authorisation). Anaconda code is       ?\n ?  a 1:1 rip of our code, except for the loading part running on the GC    ?\n ?  CPU that was rewritten by Utopia (they made it clear but some people    ?\n ?  just didn't get it).                                                    ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  Now about GCOS. We like what you're doing, even if up until now you're  ?\n ?  using our code without authorisation. But we're releasing Cobra 0.4     ?\n ?  drivecodes under GPL license so it matches the license of other files   ?\n ?  you're using. Feel free to use, abuse it and improve it! ;-)            ?\n ?  Cobra 1.0 drivecode might follow in the future, but for now we chose    ?\n ?  closed source.                                                          ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  It appears that one of our beta-testers leaked a beta of Cobra 1.0 one  ?\n ?  month ago. We'll do all beta testing by ourselves now. We find it's an  ?\n ?  amazing coincidence that a swapless chip was announced two weeks after  ?\n ?  the leak. Please don't support thieves.                                 ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?  Oh and about Idle-bug, it was a BUG, yes a BUG of our old cobra         ?\n ?  code in the way we were handling a protection. The bug is now fixed     ?\n ?  and now the laser won't go out of the data area anymore, causing idle   ?\n ?  DREs when it couldn't focus.                                            ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?

And our low-level hackers are currently working on the disc calibration ?\n ?  code to improve Direct Boot Media compatibility. We'll mess with that   ?\n ?  only when we are certain that the code won't hurt your console!         ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?                                                                          ?\n ?
