Although a one-off project with no certain plans of reconvening, the album resulting from the few days in the studio spent recording it is a landmark of experimental ambient and surprisingly unlike the various projects its contributors are known for. Closest in feel perhaps to some of the Orb&amp;#039;s more recent releases (Pomme Fritz and Orbus Terrarum), FFWD deviates strongly in its sparseness and subtlety. Fripp&amp;#039;s guitar is heavily atmospheric and subjected to the sort of heaping effects processing Fehlmann and Weston are known for; Paterson reportedly recorded hours of the virtuoso just noodling around on his six-string and assembled the bits into usable passages only after the fact. Thanks to inspired arrangements and an emphasis on texture, FFWD is also one of only a few albums to successfully figure the guitar in a central position without sounding off-balance or obligatory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158cd6db39e937ac17b02ccd4c0e05767e932663","amp;dn":"Ffwd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158cd6db39e937ac17b02ccd4c0e05767e932663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,140,214,219,57,233,55,172,23,176,44,205,76,14,5,118,126,147,38,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
