Ida Sessions, pretending to be his wife Evelyn, asks P.I. JJ Jake Gittes to investigate his adulterous ways. Jake takes photos of Hollis with a young lady. Hollis then turns up murdered, which Jake decides to investigate. Jake finds more than he was looking for. He discovers a plot to buy cheap, unwatered land for low prices, water the land, and sell it for millions of dollars. The plot is masterminded by one Noah Cross, who is Evelyn&amp;#039;s father and Hollis&amp;#039; one-time business partner. His investigation leads him to an affair with Evelyn and a discussion with Noah Cross, both of whom seem curiously interested in the girl Hollis was seen with.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2fa9960297f7df8d9240f3047fb8f0e1f5ebc1e","amp;dn":"Chinatown+DVDRip+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2fa9960297f7df8d9240f3047fb8f0e1f5ebc1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,250,153,96,41,127,125,248,217,36,15,48,71,251,143,14,31,94,188,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
