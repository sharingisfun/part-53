In fact, Russell wrote 11 of the dozen tracks within a few years of the disc's release (though he had help on a few numbers from the likes of Katy Moffatt, Nancy Griffith, and Ian Tyson). Picking standouts on an album this strong isn't easy, but if pressed you might name &quot;Walkin on the Moon,&quot; awhich is about falling in love; the melancholy &quot;Spanish Burgundy&quot;; &quot;Gallo del Cielo,&quot; about a man trying to win the money to buy back his father's land; and &quot;Navajo Rug,&quot; a nostalgic look at old times and an old love. Today many of these songs sound like standards; someday, one suspects, they will be.\n\nTracks\n\t\t\n  \t  \t1 \tBlue Wing \tRussell \t4:01\n\n  \t  \t2 \tThe Heart of the Working Man \tRussell \t2:56\n\n  \t  \t3 \tVeteran's Day \tRussell \t3:39\n\n  \t  \t4 \tWalkin' on the Moon \tMoffatt, Russell \t3:48\n\n  \t  \t5 \tOutbound Plane \tGriffith, Russell \t2:50\n\n  \t  \t6 \tBergenfield \tRussell \t3:41\n\n  \t  \t7 \tSpanish Burgundy \tRussell \t3:00\n\n  \t  \t8 \tGallo del Cielo \tRussell \t6:05\n\n  \t  \t9 \tLa Frontera \tRussell \t5:04\n\n  \t  \t10 \tNavajo Rug \tRussell, Tyson \t3:51\n\n  \t  \t11 \tUnder the Gun \tRussell, Zanes \t3:30\n\n  \t  \t12 \tThe White Trash Song \tYoung \t4:09\n\n@320 kb/s \n\nby request","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:801c1ce708ae737aaacc0644044f10c0d7e4033f","amp;dn":"Tom+Russell+-+Poor+Man%5C%27s+Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"801c1ce708ae737aaacc0644044f10c0d7e4033f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,28,28,231,8,174,115,122,170,204,6,68,4,79,16,192,215,228,3,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
