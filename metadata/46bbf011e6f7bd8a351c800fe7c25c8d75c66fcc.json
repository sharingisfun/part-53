It introduced the world to the brothers' dark and enjoyably warped vision, setting the tone for their later and increasingly famous works. Blood Simple also established the Coens as some of the most innovative filmmakers of their generation, featuring acrobatic camera manipulation and stunningly effective point-of-view shots, the most memorable of which is M. Emmet Walsh's view of a dripping sink. For his part, Walsh gave one of the best performances of his career, a savory blend of amoral sleaze and mean-eyed greed. His performance is the black heart and soul of Blood Simple, a film that churns with sadistic good humor as it delivers a brutal yet beautifully executed shot to the head.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46bbf011e6f7bd8a351c800fe7c25c8d75c66fcc","amp;dn":"Joel+Coen+-+1984+-+Blood+Simple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46bbf011e6f7bd8a351c800fe7c25c8d75c66fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,187,240,17,230,247,189,138,53,28,128,15,231,194,92,141,117,198,111,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
