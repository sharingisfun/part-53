We're not talking about just desktop backgrounds and icons here, we're talking about everything - the look of windows, menus, apps, buttons, absolutely everything. You don't wear the same clothes everyday, your house doesn't look exactly like your neighbor's - why should the computing interface you use everyday be any different. You personalize your physical workspace to suit your tastes and whims, so why not your Mac?\n\nhttp://www.unsanity.com/haxies/shapeshifter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15a6aa357de69852ae280d684f0844b449e6660","amp;dn":"Shapeshifter+2+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15a6aa357de69852ae280d684f0844b449e6660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,90,106,163,87,222,105,133,42,226,128,214,132,240,132,75,68,158,102,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
