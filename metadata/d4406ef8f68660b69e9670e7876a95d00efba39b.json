I purchased it from yesasia.com not realising that there were no English subs.  It only contains Chinese and Japanese audio with Traditional Chinese subs.  I have included both audio tracks in my first attempt at creating a Matroska video, quality isn't perfect but it's not bad for a first attempt ;-)\n\nBTW, in regards to the lack of English subs, if anyone knows a way to OCR traditional chinese subs I will be glad to translate them and upload a new file.  Just post here and let me know.\n\nGundam Z - A New Translation\n\nEncoded using Divx 5 codec\n\nAny problems playing the file please download the Matroska pack.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://packs.matroska.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://packs.matroska.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand try using a player such as the Core Media Player.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.corecoded.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.corecoded.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBLUdRAGON\n\nASIANTORRENTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4406ef8f68660b69e9670e7876a95d00efba39b","amp;dn":"Gundam+Z+A+New+Translation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4406ef8f68660b69e9670e7876a95d00efba39b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,64,110,248,246,134,96,182,158,150,112,231,135,106,149,208,14,251,163,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
