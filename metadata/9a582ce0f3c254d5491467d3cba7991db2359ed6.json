Their purpose is to show the public the exact wording of the regulations under Subchapter N, Section 861 of the Internal Revenue Code.  \n \nIt is under 1.861-8 and 1.861-8T that the rules show when foreign income is taxable and when domestic income is taxable.  As you will see for yourself, for individuals, only income derived from international and possessions commerce is taxable.  If you have taxable income, then you must pay income taxes whether you like it or not. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a582ce0f3c254d5491467d3cba7991db2359ed6","amp;dn":"The+861+Evidence.htm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a582ce0f3c254d5491467d3cba7991db2359ed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,88,44,224,243,194,84,213,73,20,103,211,203,167,153,29,178,53,158,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
