I switched it out and broke it infront of him....\n\nI replaced my brothers good gamecube with a busted one that looks exactly the same, and I smashed it. The little nintendo fanboy cried his fat little a** off............ Get the video and see the results.\n\n\nThis video has been featured all over the internet, and talked about in multiple forums. This is probably the highest quality version of it. Enjoy. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0a1c2b130fabfb96473f065496dfd2bdce6207","amp;dn":"Smashed+Gamecube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0a1c2b130fabfb96473f065496dfd2bdce6207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,10,28,43,19,15,171,251,150,71,63,6,84,150,223,210,189,206,98,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
