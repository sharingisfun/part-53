The two couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be an odder couple. Jack is an over-sexed charmer; Miles is a sad-sack worrier. Jack is looking for his Ã¢â‚¬Å“last taste of freedomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Miles just wants to taste perfection in a bottle. Jack is fine with cheap Merlot; Miles pines for the elusive, perfect Pinot. Indeed, the only thing they seem to share in common is the same heady mix of failed ambitions and fading youth. \n\nAnd yet, as they make their way up the coast, Miles and Jack soon find themselves drowning in wine and women. Jack falls head-over-heels for a local wine pourer (Sandra Oh) and threatens to call off his nuptials. Miles begins his own romantic encounter with a wine-savvy waitress (Virginia Madsen). Both men careen dangerously and comically toward mid-life crises. \n\nNow, the wedding approaches and with it the certainty that Miles and Jack wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it back to Los Angeles unscathed or unchanged . . . if they get back there at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e94cbe827eb0534445af042157b9d62d99bec723","amp;dn":"Sideways+-+2005+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e94cbe827eb0534445af042157b9d62d99bec723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,76,190,130,126,176,83,68,69,175,4,33,87,185,214,45,153,190,199,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
