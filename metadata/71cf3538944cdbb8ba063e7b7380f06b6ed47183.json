I have included the 1.2 patch and the 1.3 patch for direct3d, if you want the software mode or the glide mode patches, you can get it here:\n\nhxxp//www.3dgamers.com/games/requiem/downloads/\n\nWell, though I have the original, I never got beyond level one. I just couldn't figure out what to do, and this is the only game that I never found a walkthrough for, so if someone knows a walkthrough, please post at the comments section.\n\nEnjoy and remember: if you are a real Klingon like me, share back what you take, it is the honourable thing to do for us warriors!\n\n(By the way, because my download had a lot of errors in it, I am trying to redownload Babylon 5, season 3 disc 5. If some of you can help me to complete it, I would be very thankfull.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71cf3538944cdbb8ba063e7b7380f06b6ed47183","amp;dn":"Requiem%3A+Avenging+Angel_PC+CD-rom_2nd+try","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71cf3538944cdbb8ba063e7b7380f06b6ed47183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,207,53,56,148,76,219,184,186,6,62,123,115,128,240,107,110,212,113,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
