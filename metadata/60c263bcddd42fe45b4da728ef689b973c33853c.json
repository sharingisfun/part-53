I am currently trying to get all the DS9 torrents that were lost during the raid reseeded. bender-c offered to seed this one when it came up and has now done so (thank you). There should be quite a few seeds since we were all stuck on 99.5%. I know a lot of people are missing this DVD since I have been stuck on it since the end of May. Grab it now and seed generously. I won&amp;#039;t be of much help since I am currently uploading S5D2.\nOnce I am done with S5D2 I will do S5D3 and then start from the beginning with petsels S1D1.\nI anyone else feels like uploading some of the lost torrents I have uploaded them in a torrent available here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3504261&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3504261&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you reseed an old torrent, remember to leave a note in the comments section of one of the newer torrents also.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c263bcddd42fe45b4da728ef689b973c33853c","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+DS9+S2D3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c263bcddd42fe45b4da728ef689b973c33853c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,194,99,188,221,212,47,228,91,77,167,40,239,104,155,151,60,51,133,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
