Digital signatures removed\n   to protect the guilty.  This release is for all the great xbox homebrew \n   developers out there. WAM loves you all !!\n\n   Notes:\n   ~~~~~~\n   So Whats this? a new xdk? but microsoft said 5849 was the last one..\n   Well they straight out lied. This xdk was produced for Microsoft's\n   in house developers (Think Halo 2). What they tweaked is unknown\n   but rest assured it must be good.\n\n   -We've included the remote recovery exe for those \n   who have an official debug kit. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b17fe3de834980bcb3fe1ced6bdf8a3069168b","amp;dn":"XBOX+XDK+5933+UNOFFICIAL-WAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b17fe3de834980bcb3fe1ced6bdf8a3069168b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,177,127,227,222,131,73,128,188,179,254,28,237,107,223,138,48,105,22,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
