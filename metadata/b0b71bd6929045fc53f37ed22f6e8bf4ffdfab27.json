Things also get complicated when Antwon Mitchell moves back into town. Antwon is a former gang drug distributor who is back in Farmington in his new role as community leader. He is preaching a positive message to the gangs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of self-reliance, peace and unity. However, Mackey and Captain Rawling are convinced that Antwon's rehabilitation is a ruse. Vic even suspects that his old partner Shane is on Antwon's payroll, but Antwon is too cagey and smart to give anything away.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b71bd6929045fc53f37ed22f6e8bf4ffdfab27","amp;dn":"xv-the.shield.s04e01.dvdscr.xvid.%5BBT%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b71bd6929045fc53f37ed22f6e8bf4ffdfab27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,183,27,214,146,144,69,252,83,243,126,210,47,110,139,244,255,223,171,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
