NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul and so on?everybody&amp;#039;s got a point they&amp;#039;re determined to labour. Except, it seems, DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince, two cartoon-type characters hell-bent on mucking about. To a background of often unexpected samples?the odd toccata is thrown in with the James Brown and Sly Stone borrowings? solid bass hooks and crisp beats, they create a series of genuinely witty playlets about such nonsense as taking on Mike Tyson (I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson), going out with a vampire (Twilight Zone), cheap holidays (Everything That Glitters) and the panic when you discover your car isn&amp;#039;t where you left it (Who Stole My Car) featuring a cast of characters from winos to preachers. To see a team as obviously hip hop-talented as this (the music and phrasing is everything anyone could want) willing to risk making themselves look silly and have a bit of fun cuts through the genre like a blast of fresh air\n\n- Lloyd Bradley\n\n(Issue #41)(February 1990)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a58ba21bf3b67e14795dc0cd7290c253e2c48b","amp;dn":"DJ+Jazzy+Jeff+%26+The+Fresh+Prince+-+And+In+This+Corner+%28256k+AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a58ba21bf3b67e14795dc0cd7290c253e2c48b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,165,139,162,27,243,182,126,20,121,93,192,205,114,144,194,83,226,196,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
