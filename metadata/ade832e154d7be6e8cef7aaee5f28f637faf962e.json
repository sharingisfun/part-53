However, this is a time when I am more than impressed; I&amp;#039;m astonished. This album is truly authentic to the best of what was being recorded in the mid to late 1970s New Age synthesizer scene. This recording is almost haunting. It&amp;#039;s as if the talented musicians who recorded this album were transported through time and just started jamming. I was alive and listening in the mid to late 1970s. I&amp;#039;ve built my life around the sound of 1975 to 1985 New Age synthmusic. So, I feel that I am an authority on this subject. And I can safely say that this is a phenomenal disc. If you like Floyd, Parsons, Carlos, Tomita, Vangelis, Baumann, Tangerine Dream, or any of the other New Age notables of that era-- then give this a listen!&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade832e154d7be6e8cef7aaee5f28f637faf962e","amp;dn":"ValleyForge+-+Leaving+To+Nothing+%28New+Age%2C+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade832e154d7be6e8cef7aaee5f28f637faf962e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,232,50,225,84,215,190,110,140,239,122,174,229,242,143,99,127,175,150,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
