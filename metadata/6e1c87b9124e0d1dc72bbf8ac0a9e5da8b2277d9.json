He has a lot of fun introducing Miles Davis' &amp;quot;Solar,&amp;quot; at first playing around with what sounds like a Scottish dirge and sneaking into a bit of the song while giving it an Oriental flavor, before getting down to business. Both &amp;quot;I Remember You&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Autumn in New York&amp;quot; are long but fascinating interpretations, as the pianist deconstructs and rebuilds each of them with very fresh approaches. This very satisfying concert CD is well-worth acquiring.\n\n\nTracks\n\t \t1 \t\tOld Folks \tHill, Robison \t6:35\n  \t  \t2 \t\tSolar \tDavis \t9:48\n  \t  \t3 \t\tDon't Explain \tHerzog, Holiday \t8:25\n  \t  \t4 \t\tI Remember You \tMercer, Schertzinger \t10:21\n  \t  \t5 \t\tAutumn in New York \tDuke \t10:55\n  \t  \t6 \t\tThe Meaning of the Blues \t\t6:18","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e1c87b9124e0d1dc72bbf8ac0a9e5da8b2277d9","amp;dn":"JAZZ-+Steve+Kuhn+-+Live+At+Maybeck+Recital+Hall%2C+Vol.+13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e1c87b9124e0d1dc72bbf8ac0a9e5da8b2277d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,28,135,185,18,78,13,29,199,43,191,138,192,169,229,218,139,34,119,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
