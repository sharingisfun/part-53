This 06/06/06 CVS build is the first with the MC360 skin, an X360 reproduction skin for XboxMediaCenter.\nThis T3CH-compile is a complete snapshot of what is in CVS at the time the build was compiled, with just a few small additions.\nXBMC is in a FEATUREFREEZE at the moment. If you want to report bugs, please do it the PROPER way, see here.\n\nNoteworthy, XML and Script changes in this build:\n* The date 060606 brings us MC360 BETA version.\n* !THIS IS NOT XBMC 2.0.0, XBMC is still pre 2.0.0!\n* The change of location for GUI settings is a big change.\nYou will have to redo all your GUI settings (unless you have them specified in AdvancedSettings.xml)\nAlso changed is that all tags in AdvancedSettings.xml needs to be lowercase.\n* If you wondered what happened to XBoxMediaCenter.xml, More info here and here.\n* changed: redid master lock. thanks to smokehead for skin work! (won&amp;#039;t work with MC360)\n* changed: Settings cleanup (simplified programs + video auto-switching, removed some that are no longer necessary)\n* changed: TDATA\\0face008\\settings.xml moved to UserData\\guisettings.xml\n* Keymap.xml: no changes\n* XBoxMediaCenter.xml: All lockcodes (shares) must now be MD5 hashed!\n\n\nSpecial Note From Team Blackbolt:\n[QUOTE]\nTeam Blackbolt would like to thank the many users who followed our project with great respect, Its not often a project like this gets this much attention, but you have made us welcome. We are very proud to present this 0.966 beta to you through T3CH.
