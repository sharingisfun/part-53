This has Cecilia really\nfleshing out the groove she first explored on &quot;Waltz For Koop&quot; -- a spacious,\nsoulful mode that brings together older modes of scatting and vocals with a\nfreshly jazzy sensibility -- one that's clearly tuned on the tones of the\ncurrent club jazz underground, but which also has a lot more to offer than\nstrictly dancefloor jazz! There's a depth here that's really tremendous -- a\nquality that easily puts the record at a level with some of our favorite jazz\nvocal work from older years -- including albums by Carmen Lundy, Dee Dee\nBridgewater, and others. But Cecilia's also got an ear for the fresher sounds of\nthe 21st century too -- and although the album's an all-acoustic, jazz-based\nset, it's sure to cross over nicely with fans of Koop and others from the\nEuropean scene! Titles include &quot;Bogaloo Boy&quot;, &quot;Lover's Bolero&quot;, &quot;Straight Up&quot;,\n&quot;Everything Must Change&quot;, &quot;Sustain&quot;, &quot;Fast Food&quot;, and &quot;Simplicity&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7e27f45e6bbe54c34352a7210f74537cd458d56","amp;dn":"Cecilia_Stalin-Straight_Up-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7e27f45e6bbe54c34352a7210f74537cd458d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,226,127,69,230,187,229,76,52,53,42,114,16,247,69,55,205,69,141,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
