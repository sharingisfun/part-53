When assassins from Agent 47?s contract killing firm, The ICA, are systematically eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger more powerful agency has entered the fray. Sensing that he may be the next target, Agent 47 travels to America, where he Prepares to Make a Killing.\n\n\nInstall Notes: \n\nOK this is a fully working demo of the game, but they have a protection on it\nthat doesn&amp;#039;t allow it to run on a modded xbox, there is a simple way around this. If you do not use these steps the screen will stay loading forever. \n\n1. Extract image &amp; FTP to the xbox. (OR burn the Image to disk)\n\n2. Now you have to go into the xbox file explorer on your xbox and choose\n   the location where you saved HitmanBloodMoney E drive or F drive witch-\n   ever you saved it to, now locate the hitmanbloodmoney.XBE or default.xbe file\n   and click it and the game should launch and go past the loading.\n           \n3. PLAY!!!\n   \n   \nOther Notes: Other Xbox games had this issue to like Mech Assault 2 and \n007 Everything or Nothing. There may be a way to patch it. \n\n\nStep 2\n\nAnother way is to burn the image and boot up the xbox with the disk in the drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1787e8c6c7a966f417eebcd04bff07fcb3bc09c6","amp;dn":"Hitman+BloodMoneyDemo.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1787e8c6c7a966f417eebcd04bff07fcb3bc09c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,135,232,198,199,169,102,244,23,238,188,208,75,255,7,252,179,188,9,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
