I know i haven't posted as much as normal lately, but thats about to change........things should get back to normal this month. So expect lots of videos i said i would rip and many more, enjoy!\n\nDickies - The Venue Edinburgh Scotland 4th October 1995 VCD 67m\n\nThis is in PAL VCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin &amp; cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/\n\nEnjoy bandit999\n\nwww.punktorrents.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d69c7bc717cb10aaab5fe645badb4ae9dce09bae","amp;dn":"Dickies+-+The+Venue+Edinburgh+4th+Oct+1995+VCD%5Bbandit999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d69c7bc717cb10aaab5fe645badb4ae9dce09bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,156,123,199,23,203,16,170,171,95,230,69,186,219,74,233,220,224,155,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
