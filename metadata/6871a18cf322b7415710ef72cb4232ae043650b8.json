A quiet, guarded man, Walter finds unexpected solace from Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick), a tough-talking woman who promises not to judge him for his history. But Walter cannot escape his past. A convicted sex offender, Walter is warily eyed by his brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt), shunned by his sister, lives in fear of being discovered at work, and is hounded by a suspicious local police office, Detective Lucas (Mos Def). After befriending a young girl in a neighborhood park, Walter must also grapple with the terrible prospect of his own reawakened demons. \n\nThe Woodsman -- based on a play of the same name, directed by Nicole Kassell produced by Lee Daniels, to be distributed domestically by Newmarket Films -- is an unnerving, ultimately hopeful portrait of compulsion and hard-won redemption. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6871a18cf322b7415710ef72cb4232ae043650b8","amp;dn":"The+Woodsman+-+2005+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6871a18cf322b7415710ef72cb4232ae043650b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,113,161,140,243,34,183,65,87,16,239,114,203,66,50,174,4,54,80,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
