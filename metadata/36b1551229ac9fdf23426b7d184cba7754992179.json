A prolific songwriter (as proven by this extensive collection), \nClarke was equally capable of gripping social commentary (&quot;Last Decade, Dead Century,&quot; &quot;American&quot;) \nand pointless utopian ramblings (&quot;5 Ways to the Gutter&quot; and the two hidden tracks at album&amp;#039;s end).\n Some of which may have seemed revolutionary when written but now sound like Bart Simpson waxing philosophical.\n The quality of the material contained herein varies wildly, but for every two or three throwaway tracks,\nWarrior Soul still offers a semi-compelling nugget like &quot;NYC Girl&quot; or &quot;Turn On.&quot; These are outtakes after all.\n For fanatics only. ~ Ed Rivadavia, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b1551229ac9fdf23426b7d184cba7754992179","amp;dn":"Warrior+Soul+-+Odds+and+Ends+%28Fucker%29+1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b1551229ac9fdf23426b7d184cba7754992179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,177,85,18,41,172,159,223,35,66,107,125,24,76,186,119,84,153,33,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
