Landreth uses actual recordings of his conversations with Ryan and animates them using a technique he calls ?psycho-realism?- his characters are drawn in a way that allows their inner scars to be seen externally.&quot;\n\nThis animation is an orgy between creativity and imagination. You have to understand that this is a documentary about Ryan Larkin, A Canadian who pioneered animated drawings in the late 1960's. \nSo, it is a documentary about the fall of an artist, a pioneering animator, by an animator, through animation. It is a view of life at its rawest. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c5a99f8f6afdcd8460053d805df18b768aaace","amp;dn":"%5BDOCUMENTARY%5DRYAN%28must+see%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c5a99f8f6afdcd8460053d805df18b768aaace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,197,169,159,143,106,253,205,132,96,5,61,128,93,241,139,118,138,170,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
