These corporate, religious, or governmental organizations have their own best interests in mind, and use their considerable power to maintain the status quo. This series of investigations reveals some of the hidden secrets. &quot;Monopoly Men&quot; - The Federal Reserve, or the Fed as it is lovingly called, may be one of the most mysterious entities in modern American government. \n\nCreated during Wilson's presidency to protect the economy in times of financial turmoil, its real business remains to be discovered.
