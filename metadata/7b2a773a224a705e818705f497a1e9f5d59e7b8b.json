We exist to serve the  \n      scene  with  quality  releases,  and to help the scene    \n      maintain  some vestige of its former self.                  \n                                                                  \n        5000 fully working releases, and we&amp;#039;re still dedicated    \n        to what  we do best,  bringing u  quality keygens,  in  \n      style! We&amp;#039;ve been around for over 6 years now,  and we  \n      aren&amp;#039;t planning on leaving anytime soon.              \n                                                              \n      Times have changed since we  first started doing this,    \n      and so have we,  but we&amp;#039;re still here.  It is however,      \n    time that  the scene  itself starts  embracing some of    \n      this change aswell,  instead of  dwelling on the past.    \n        Because of this,  we would like to ask  all our fellow  \n      sceners to consider the following:                    \n                                                                    \n          STOP FLOODING OUR SITES WITH CRAP!    We have enforced    \n          a 1-month MU  rule on our  own releases,  and we would    \n          like  YOU  to follow our  lead.  Everyone is  tired of    \n          releasing/testing/trading  the same releases over  and    \n          over again, and it&amp;#039;s up to *us*  to change this. There    \n          are plenty of uncracked, useful applications out there,  \n          begging for some attention.  So stop wasting your time    \n          on crap just because it updates a lot and it serves in    \n          boosting  the number of  releases your group does.  We    \n          know  that we&amp;#039;ve done  similar things in the past,  as    \n          most groups, but this doesnt dismiss the truth in this    \n          message, its never too late to change.                    \n                                                                    \n          In  light of  this same issue,  we would also  like to    \n          encourage  everyone to  TEST  your  releases! We spend    \n          *a lot* of time to make sure everything we pre  WORKS,    \n          and so should you!
