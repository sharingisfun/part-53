I broke it in to 4 files of varying quality (all good though) to test various quality schemes.\nThere needs to be more seeding done everyone. Lots of people are hitting and running!\nAlso, give me some feedback about file sizes what is your preferred quality versus size ratio?  If you prefer a really small size I can up the Japanese Sumo Digest show, showing only the actual bouts (without the bout preparation).  No English audio, and lacks the 'flavor' of the tournament, but can be upped in a very small size (25 minute program).  I think what I will do is take the first half (lower ranking wrestsers and sometimes special interview) of the 2 hour program, and encode it at a lower rate, and keep the last half (the more exciting bouts) at a higher rate.\n\nDay 1: http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3429232\nDay 2: http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3429888","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:494b735e8195d96df26882f6429d61c55d7a6b5b","amp;dn":"Sumo+Day+3+January+10+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"494b735e8195d96df26882f6429d61c55d7a6b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,75,115,94,129,149,217,109,242,104,130,246,66,157,97,197,93,122,107,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
