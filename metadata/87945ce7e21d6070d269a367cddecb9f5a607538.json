All source models are included \n\nif you wish to play with them some more. \n\nIts not perfect but better than what is currently available, ie nothing. \n\nFeel free to improve on it!\n\nAnother great release from The Dark Judges! :)\n\n\nMay the force be with you!\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87945ce7e21d6070d269a367cddecb9f5a607538","amp;dn":"STARWARS+The+Battle+Of+Endor+Texture+Pack.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87945ce7e21d6070d269a367cddecb9f5a607538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,148,92,231,226,29,96,112,210,105,163,103,205,222,203,159,90,96,117,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
