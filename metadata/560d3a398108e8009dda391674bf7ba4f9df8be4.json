If you want to burn to DVD-5, go ahead and transcode or re-encode to burn whatever version of the disc you want.  Personally I would make 2 discs:\n\n1) only the film on it - no menus.  English 5.1 and keep the subs.\n2) full disc - same as original but more compressed.\n\nThey double-dipped me on this one, so I think the old version of the movie (that I bought and post here) is fair game :)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560d3a398108e8009dda391674bf7ba4f9df8be4","amp;dn":"Donnie+Darko+%28DVD-9+NTSC+2.35%3A1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560d3a398108e8009dda391674bf7ba4f9df8be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,13,58,57,129,8,232,0,157,218,57,22,116,191,123,164,249,223,139,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
