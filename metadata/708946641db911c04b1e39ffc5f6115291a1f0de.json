Don Grange doing all the explaining. This is followed by an extensive simulator session. The best part is saved for the end - a hand flown landing at Kai Tak, Hong Kong. The landing is a multi camera shoot with both external and cockpit views. \n\nInformative and entertaining at the same time. The best aviation video I've seen, ever.\n\nCodec - DivX/MP3\n\nRuntime - 1 Hour\n\nComments - Excellent video quality, slight off spec aspect ratio easily corrected using FFDShow's display filters. Also recommend same for de-interlacing.\n\nEnjoy!\nFlightMaster\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:708946641db911c04b1e39ffc5f6115291a1f0de","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Video+-+ITVV+B747%3A+Heathrow+-+Kai+Tak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"708946641db911c04b1e39ffc5f6115291a1f0de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,137,70,100,29,185,17,192,75,30,57,255,197,246,17,82,145,161,240,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
