The original program dosn't allow a centerprint closer than app. 33 mm. This one allows it just as you want. You only need to use it when you want to change print-area outside (118 to 15 mm) that allowed form normal area (118 to 33 mm). Great little extra program to make your CD/DVD's perfect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa123affd02c41e59e931a98d60f0f09ce762f7","amp;dn":"PixmaCdSizer_Final_Setup.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa123affd02c41e59e931a98d60f0f09ce762f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,161,35,175,253,2,196,30,89,233,49,169,141,96,240,240,156,231,98,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
