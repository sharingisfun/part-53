Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes\nyou get this too).\n\n\nI noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter\nthan the B&amp;W versions.  In Brats, for example, you'll see that\nsome small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is\nshorter than the restored B&amp;W version.

Note that colourised\nversions are not as sharp as the B&amp;W versions, although this is\nnormal if you've ever viewed a colourised version before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86df834f2ab4293393fa3be7785631a395f9a988","amp;dn":"Laurel+and+Hardy+DVD+Vol+1+%28of+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86df834f2ab4293393fa3be7785631a395f9a988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,223,131,79,42,180,41,51,147,250,59,231,120,86,49,163,149,249,169,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
