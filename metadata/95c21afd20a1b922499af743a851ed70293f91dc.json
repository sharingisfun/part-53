Because it is too dangerous to meet in person, the team is able to obtain the extraordinary footage described above only after giving a camera to an intermediary, who deals with insurgents to obtain the gripping video. After receiving the tape, the team then combines the footage with other interviews and independent analysis to build a complex profile of insurgent forces. &quot;The Insurgency&quot; also includes compelling personal video from Australian journalist Michael Ware, Baghdad bureau chief for Time magazine and one of the reporters with the most in-depth access to insurgent leaders.\n\n&quot;The Insurgency&quot; goes to the city of Tal Afar shortly after it is retaken by U.S. and Iraqi troops to document the brutality inflicted there by Al Qaeda in Iraq. The insurgents had utilized the northwestern city as a staging post for equipment and reinforcements brought in through Syria and had terrorized the local population. &quot;They killed [my brother]. They cut his stomach open and put bombs inside,&quot; says one resident. &quot;They left him by the roundabout next to the petrol station. My father wanted to go and pick his body up. They blew up my father.&quot;\n\nOther insurgent groups condemn this behavior. Abu Mohammed, for example, draws the line at killing innocents: &quot;The national resistance does not accept these actions. We do not accept the killing of civilians or the Iraqi National Guard or the police. We do not accept the killing of any Iraqi.&quot;\n\nMore info: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/insurgency/\n\nAVI File Details\n===============================================================================\nName.........: PBS Frontline (Feb 2006) The Insurgency (XviD 55m20s) ConRes.avi\nFilesize.....: 348 MB (or 357,226 KB or 365,799,424 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:55:20 (99,494 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 770 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 103 kb/s (51/ch, stereo) VBR \nFrame Size...: 544x416 (1.31:1) [=17:13]\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nPeace :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c21afd20a1b922499af743a851ed70293f91dc","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline+%28Feb+2006%29+The+Insurgency+%28XviD+55m20s%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c21afd20a1b922499af743a851ed70293f91dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,194,26,253,32,161,185,34,73,154,247,67,168,81,237,112,41,63,145,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
