The once-homicidal youths of Gatlin, Nebraska are back, transported to a nearby town to be re-integrated into society (they have no recollection of the massacre from the previous film). In no time at all they succumb once again to the devilish influence of a young leader (Ryan Bollman), who organizes them to take murderous action against suspicious adults; those who stumble too close to their secret become blood sacrifices to \\&quot;He Who Walks Behind The Rows.\\&quot; The scenario of the first film is recreated here ? albeit with slight variations and more imaginative death scenes ? with little explanation given regarding the true source of the kids\\&amp;#039; demonic power. A clever subplot suggests that a strain of corn-smut toxin may be responsible for their homicidal mania, but little is done with it. Followed by even more sequels.\n\nExtra features: Scene Access.. \n\nDVD5 not ripped.\n\nMore Details: www.dvdquorum.es","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1496a1749a0a9a18195be20b6c9cc70c4ee02733","amp;dn":"Children_of_the_Corn_II_The_Final_Sacrifice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1496a1749a0a9a18195be20b6c9cc70c4ee02733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,150,161,116,154,10,154,24,25,91,226,11,108,156,199,12,78,224,39,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
