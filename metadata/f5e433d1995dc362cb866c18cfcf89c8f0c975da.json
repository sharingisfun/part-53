Pentagram)\nLive at the Silver Fox, Northern Virginia, USA\nFeb. 20, 1983\nVCD format - 2 MPG files that will burn to VCD \n\nApprox. one hour &amp; 40 minutes in length\n\nVHS-to-DVD transfer of a 2nd generation audience video tape, one camera, tripod-mounted. Never released commercially.\n\nQuality -- I would give it about a 7 on a scale of 1-10. However, considering the rarity of the footage, I'd give it an 11 for pure doom rock overkill! There are a couple of places where songs are cut off, or start mid-way through. That was done on the original tape -- not by me.\n\nMore about the band here: http://www.ramshead.org\n\nSongs (I need help with a couple of these):\n\n1. Death Row\n2. All Your Sins\n3. Pentagram (Sign of the Wolf)\n4. Run My Course\n5. Guitar solo - Living in a Ram's Head\n6. When the Screams Come\n7. ?\n8. The Ghoul\n9. Vengence\n10. You Give the Feeling of Dread\n11. Sinister\n12. Bass Solo (song title?)\n13. Evil Seed\n14. Live Free and Burn\n15. Petrified (partial)\n16. Drum Solo\n17. Walk Through the Shadows\n18. Dying World (partial)\n19. 20 Buck Spin\n20. Sweet Leaf\n\nPlease share this video with friends, but do not sell! Thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e433d1995dc362cb866c18cfcf89c8f0c975da","amp;dn":"DEATH+ROW+%28Pentagram%29+Live+1983+Video+VCD+Doom+Rock+Metal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e433d1995dc362cb866c18cfcf89c8f0c975da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,228,51,209,153,93,195,98,203,134,108,24,207,207,137,200,240,201,117,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
