Basically, he plays contemporary classical music, but often fusioned with jazz or other genres, in many cases with a brilliant result. His musical strayings cannot easily be compared to those of other artists. \nThis is his most recent album, but he has made/participated in a number of discs earlier. Sadly, most of them are rather difficult to find.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:589d4fb70e150b2756f8f629223918c133881298","amp;dn":"Michael+Riessler-Ahi+Vita+%28contempor.+classical%2Fjazz%29byDraugei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"589d4fb70e150b2756f8f629223918c133881298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,157,79,183,14,21,11,39,86,248,246,41,34,57,24,193,51,136,18,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
