Sometimes it's even better than playing on a\nreal Playstation. That is if you got the game to actually\nwork, which seems to be a difficult task. Because of that\nfew will choose to play PSX on the Xbox and a game will be\nhard to find, as it already is. The Xbox community is big\nand by introducing the PSX there a dying race might rise\nagain, or at least not be forgotten. And others, both old\nand new, will have a chance to enjoy what once ruled the\nearth. Please help this community by putting this entire\ntag in your torrent description along with details of\nPcsxbox configuration for the game. By having this tag a\ngame will surely work on the Xbox when making a search on\nPCSXBOX. While making a simple search on PSX others can\nenjoy it on other systems as well.\n\n/Thanks for sharing.\n----------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5424a2a4998eec8daca29286774c0794e03cfd","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+IX+%5BPSXBOX%5D+.RAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5424a2a4998eec8daca29286774c0794e03cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,84,36,162,164,153,142,236,141,172,162,146,134,119,76,7,148,224,60,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
