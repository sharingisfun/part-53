Some of the corpses shown were clearly killed by the chemical agent white phosphorus, which burns off their flesh while their clothes remain intact.\n\nAlso discussed is the use of a gelled-fuel fire bomb MK77, commonly called napalm, against Iraqi populations, as well as the extreme difficulty of reporting from Fallujah.\n\nWhile US commanders had initially denied the use of white phosphorus as a weapon against populations, they have yesterday admitted to using it against the citizens of Fallujah.
