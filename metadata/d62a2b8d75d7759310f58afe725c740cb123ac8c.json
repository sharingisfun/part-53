For rather than offering you still another accumulation of raw factsÃ¢â‚¬â€the dates, battles, elections, treaties or forms of government youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already spent a lifetime assimilatingÃ¢â‚¬â€this course speaks, instead, to the why of things, the significance of those facts, and the way they fit together to reflect the past and foreshadow the future.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what a deep understanding of history is really about. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we believe you deserve in a course designed to provoke and stimulate everyone who has finally come to understand that when it comes to history, facts alone are simply not enough.\n\nIn these lecturesÃ¢â‚¬â€taught by three history professors of exceptional insight and teaching skillÃ¢â‚¬â€youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll experience the past four centuries not simply as a torrent of sequentially linked events, but as an ongoing evolution of intellectual and social forces, within which even the facts youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known for years bristle with the kind of fresh, provocative meaning that makes your commitment to lifelong learning a joy.\n\nThe History of the United States begins with Professor Darren Staloff, who looks at our countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past from a sharp new perspective.\n\nHave you ever wondered what the colonistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ relations with the Amerindian population were like? Would you be surprised to learn that the brutality of colonial military tactics shocked and horrified even the most battle-hardened Indian warriors?\n\nWould it surprise you to learn that the PuritansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ideas about romantic love and sex were vastly different than what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been led to believe? Or that their own profound love for their children meant that those children would often be raised by someone else? Or that the Salem Witch Trials ironically resulted in the execution of the most devout community members? Or that slavery may have contributed to the development of democracy? \n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to hear all of these provocative ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€and many moreÃ¢â‚¬â€presented, discussed, and placed in context as you see our country take shape.\n\nIn Parts III and IV, Professor Louis Masur of The City College of New York continues the story of the young nation with its initial struggles of identity through the Civil War and Reconstruction. Professor Masur covers a period of incredible intellectual turmoilÃ¢â‚¬â€revivalism, transcendentalism, abolitionism, feminism, utopianism, and nativism. And hearing his treatment of this period and its concerns offers you a perfect demonstration of why he has been honored with HarvardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s John Clive Prize for Excellence in Teaching, and why it is such a joy to learn from teachers this qualified and this skilled.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a joy that will continue for you in Parts V-VII, by Professor James Shenton of Columbia University, a canny analyst and remarkable storyteller, the 1973 recipient of the Mark Van Doren Teaching Prize who has subsequently received virtually every teaching honor Columbia can bestow.\n\nHave recent years taught us that political parties will do just about anything to win the presidency? Wait until you hear Professor ShentonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discussion of the infamous Compromise of 1877, when the Democrats literally traded away the White House so that Reconstruction could be ended in the SouthÃ¢â‚¬â€accepting a bargain that would condemn millions of Americans to second-class citizenship for most of the next century.\n\nDo you believe the 1960s represented the pinnacle of citizen discontent with the government? Then listen to Dr. Shenton discuss the Great DepressionÃ¢â‚¬â€and the Secret Service agent whose lasting memory of President and Mrs. Hoover is of them walking into a White House event carrying handguns, lest someone try to shoot them!\n\nAs the course moves towards its conclusion, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come away with a true sense of intellectual and historical context. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how the legacy of figures like Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â€each put into place by Professor ShentonÃ¢â‚¬â€fits into the overall framework built in previous lectures by Professors Staloff and Masur.\n\nThese 70 lectures represent a wonderful opportunity for you to walk through the hallways of American history, observing events and sifting ideas. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come away from these lectures not only knowing what happened, but whyÃ¢â‚¬â€and what all of it may mean for our countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Should I buy Audio or Video?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPlease Note: \nThis course is available on audio only.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62a2b8d75d7759310f58afe725c740cb123ac8c","amp;dn":"TCC+-+Darren+Staloff+and+Louis+Masur+-+The+History+of+the+United","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62a2b8d75d7759310f58afe725c740cb123ac8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,42,43,141,117,215,117,147,16,245,138,254,114,92,116,12,177,35,172,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
