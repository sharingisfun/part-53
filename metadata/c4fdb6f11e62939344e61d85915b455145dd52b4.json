The pirates have been selling copies of masters stolen from the studios and radio stations as well as poor quality versions recorded off the radio. Now there&amp;#039;s a legally-made, well packaged sixteen-track collection featuring some of the best locally produced reggae songs of the day from a line-up of popular artistes.\n\nEntitled Reggae Road Block, the CD has been produced on the Caribbean Music Group Label and features songs from the likes of Khari Kill, Prophet Benjamin, Isasha, Queen Omega, Benjai and Mr. King. The CD is expected to hit stores on Friday 9th December on both the local and international markets. Also in the works is a Reggae Road Block CD collection, of which the second CD should be available within coming months.\n\nTracks on Reggae Road Block include; ?Pretty Boy?, ?Usual Suspect? and ?Coming From Moruga? by Prophet Benjamin, ?Don?t You Know? by Isasha; ?Picture Of Selasie? and ?Jesus? by Khari Kill; ?Oh Laventille? and ?Old Dog? by Mr. King;? Got Something? by Benjai; ?Politricks? by Queen Omega and ?If I Didn?t Love You? by Juicy and ?One Family? by Million Voice. \n\n1 Pretty Boy.mp3\t        8.82 MB\n02 Don&amp;#039;t You Know.mp3\t         7.82 MB\n03 Picture Of Selassie I.mp3\t7.29 MB\n04 Oh Laventille.mp3\t        7.30 MB\n05 Usual Suspects.mp3\t        8.43 MB\n06 Coming From Moruga.mp3\t7.74 MB\n07 Politricks.mp3\t        7.81 MB\n08 If I Didnt Love You.mp3\t7.39 MB\n09 One Family.mp3\t        7.53 MB\n10 Saving All Your Love.mp3\t8.57 MB\n11 Got Something.mp3\t        5.84 MB\n12 Jesus.mp3\t                7.97 MB\n13 Bad Man.mp3\t                7.09 MB\n14 Old Dog.mp3\t                7.80 MB\n15 Herbalize.mp3\t        7.76 MB\n16 Bonus Track -Coming From Bronx.mp3\t7.69 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4fdb6f11e62939344e61d85915b455145dd52b4","amp;dn":"Reggae+Road+Block+-+Trinidad+Reggae","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4fdb6f11e62939344e61d85915b455145dd52b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,253,182,241,30,98,147,147,68,230,29,133,145,91,69,81,69,221,82,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
