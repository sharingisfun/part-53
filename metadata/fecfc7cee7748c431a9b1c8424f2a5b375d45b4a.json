The band were from Venezuela but were fronted by a North American vocalist and created some storming fuzz acid garage rock that definitely lives up to its lofty reputation.&amp;quot;-FE\n\nThis band was formed by an American traveller with some Venezuelan musicians he met along the way. They only cut the one album, I believe.\nHeavy psych-rock with some great acidic lead-guitar. This is from the Essex re-ish.\nEnjoy!\nbrainticket","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fecfc7cee7748c431a9b1c8424f2a5b375d45b4a","amp;dn":"Ladies+W+C++-+s%2Ft+%28Heavy+Psych+Rock%2C+Venezuela+1970%29%28256%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fecfc7cee7748c431a9b1c8424f2a5b375d45b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,207,199,206,231,116,140,67,26,155,28,132,36,242,165,179,117,212,91,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
