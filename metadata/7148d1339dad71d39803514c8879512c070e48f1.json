I wanted this disc to be a bit more retro, more of a Deep Purple/Rainbow type of thing and little less on the speed metal side. And with Brian Troch's raspy bluesier voice and the obvious Rainbow/Purple plagiarisms in The Devil's Playground, All Things Must End , Take Your Life and Change I think managed just that. And as I go back and listen to some of the tracks years later , some the riffs and nice melodies really hold up over time. I remember many of the longer solos are all totally improvised (You Turn My World Around, All Things Must End, Hell and Back) and it's always great to capture some very inspired playing onto tape. Plus you can't beat that two Strat metal messiah cover shot on the Japanese edition of the CD. Leviathan is considering re-releasing both this and Light In The Sky as a double pack sometime this year so perhaps they'll resurface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7148d1339dad71d39803514c8879512c070e48f1","amp;dn":"Joe+Stump+-+Second+Coming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7148d1339dad71d39803514c8879512c070e48f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,72,209,51,157,173,113,211,152,3,81,76,136,121,81,44,7,14,72,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
