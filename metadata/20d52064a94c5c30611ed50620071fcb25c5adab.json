It was later reissued in a die-cut digi-pak. &quot;Raising Earthly Spirits&quot; was Robin Storey's second outing under the name Rapoon, following the 1992 release of &quot;Dream Circle&quot; by Canadian label Death of Vinyl. It was his first release for Staalplaat, and was evocative of his earlier work in Zoviet France, a group he co-founded but had recently left.. Since this CD there have been nearly ten Rapoon releases issued by Staalplaat and Soleilmoon, but this, his first work for Staalplaat, has been out of print for more than two years.\n\nThe music on &quot;Raising Earthly Spirits&quot; features long minimalist ambient textures combined with simple yet effective rhythmic pulses. As is true of all of his musical projects, all of the artwork used on this CD was created by Robin Storey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d52064a94c5c30611ed50620071fcb25c5adab","amp;dn":"Rapoon+-+Raising+Earthly+Spirits+%28VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d52064a94c5c30611ed50620071fcb25c5adab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,213,32,100,169,76,92,48,97,30,213,6,32,7,31,203,37,197,173,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
