Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence\nlay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.&quot;\n\nThis is the real thing, not the ridiculous, cheesey de Bont 1999 remake.  In glorious black and white, this film pays fairly close attention to Shirley Jackson&amp;#039;s horror classic.  This movie is atmospheric horror, not the cheap startles and CGI generated blood and guts of the remake.  No blood and guts needed here.  There&amp;#039;s sufficient psychological creepiness here for all.\n\nBeautfully directed by Robert Wise (&quot;The Day the Earch Stood Still&quot;, &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, &quot;Sound of Music&quot;, etc.)\n\nWell acted by all involved.  A true classic of the genre.\n\nIncludes French and Spanish subs.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n*** Technical Details ***\n\nHigh quality transcode:\n\nVideo format: NTSC\nFPS: 23.976\nSize: 768 x 336\nVideo bitrate (kbps): 1532\nVideo codec: xvid\n\nLanguage: en\nAudio codec: ac3\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps):  192\n\nEncoded by transcode 1.0.2 on Gentoo Linux\n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c62b2ec5749d41c42f0073f9e3ebb6c30fccae","amp;dn":"The+Haunting+-+1953+-+Dir%3A+Robt+Wise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c62b2ec5749d41c42f0073f9e3ebb6c30fccae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,198,43,46,197,116,157,65,196,47,0,115,249,227,235,182,195,15,204,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
