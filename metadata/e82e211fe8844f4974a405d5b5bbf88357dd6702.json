He has followed it up with Slow New York, hailed by critics as a worthy follow-up.\n\nBased in New York City, Julian co-wrote two songs on the Norah Jones album Feels Like Home. His admirers include Jill Sobule, Randy Newman and Bonnie Raitt.\n\nAmong Julian&amp;#039;s other side projects is a Willie Nelson tribute band, the Little Willies.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82e211fe8844f4974a405d5b5bbf88357dd6702","amp;dn":"Richard+Julian+Anthology+-+128k+-+Mr.MOjave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82e211fe8844f4974a405d5b5bbf88357dd6702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,46,33,31,232,132,79,73,116,164,5,213,181,187,248,131,87,221,103,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
