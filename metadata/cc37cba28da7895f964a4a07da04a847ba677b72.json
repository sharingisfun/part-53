The film, never before shown in the U.S., aired during the Friday broadcast of Democracy Now!, at 9 a.m. EST. Afghan Massacre: the Convoy of Death has been broadcast on national television in Britain, Germany, Italy and Australia and has been screened by the European parliament.\n\nProduced and directed by Irish filmmaker and former BBC producer Jamie Doran, the film tells the story of thousands of prisoners who surrendered to the US military?s Afghan allies after the siege of Kunduz. According to the film, some three thousand of the prisoners were forced into sealed containers and loaded onto trucks for transport to Sheberghan prison. When the prisoners began shouting for air, U.S.-allied Afghan soldiers fired directly into the truck, killing many of them. The rest suffered through an appalling road trip lasting up to four days, so thirsty they clawed at the skin of their fellow prisoners as they licked perspiration and even drank blood from open wounds.\n\nWitnesses say that when the trucks arrived and soldiers opened the containers, most of the people inside were dead. They also say US Special Forces re-directed the containers carrying the living and dead into the desert and stood by as survivors were shot and buried. Now, up to three thousand bodies lie buried in a mass grave.\n\nOutraged human rights groups and lawyers are calling for an investigation but the U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan refuses any U.N.-backed investigation until the Afghan government can protect witnesses. Two of the witnesses in the film have already been killed.\n\nRuntime......: 00:50:13\nVideo Codec..: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate: 495 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 64 kb/s\nFrame Size...: 352x198","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc37cba28da7895f964a4a07da04a847ba677b72","amp;dn":"Afghan+Massacre+-+The+Convoy+of+Death+%28Aspect+Ratio+Fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc37cba28da7895f964a4a07da04a847ba677b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,55,203,162,141,167,137,95,150,74,74,7,218,4,168,71,186,103,123,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
