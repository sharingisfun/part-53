The main feature has been for the series to borrow many different anime licences of mechas and characters from different shows and mix them together. What is different about this game is that it does NOT feature any anime characters or mechas, but only original ones from the Super Robot Taisen series. This means that the character development of new characters is much more focused on, rather then like in the other games in the series, se anime characters from different shows interact with one another, and that the mechas can have a much more original design unlike anything you have seen before.\n\nIn the game you move your mechas around on a map and try to complete the maps goal. You are often outnumbered by many more enemy mechas so strategy is the key to wining. The game also has a reputation for some of the coolest battle animations you have ever seen and they truly are great in this game as well as the game has among the best graphics I have seen on a GBA. And donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember to use the abilities of your mecha pilots as well as that can often save your life from a big beating.\n\nImages: http://img20.exs.cx/img20/5118/og25yw.jpg\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d5f083709d68f97e887fd37dda072fa8fed092","amp;dn":"Super+Robot+Taisen+-+Original+Generation+2+%5BGBA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d5f083709d68f97e887fd37dda072fa8fed092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,213,240,131,112,157,104,249,126,136,127,211,125,218,7,47,168,254,208,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
