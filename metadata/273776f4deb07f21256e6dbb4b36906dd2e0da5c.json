With a hint of psychedelic touches to accompany their influences of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, the three-piece went into the studio to record their debut full-length in 1999. With their added use of Hammond keyboards, film samples, and overdubbed instruments, The Last Adventures of Captain Dog resulted later on that same year through their own funding.\n~ Mike DaRonco, All Music Guide\n\nhome:\nhttp://www.stonerrock.com/blinddog/\n\nsome reviews:\nhttp://www.stonerrock.com/blinddog/reviews_again.html\n\nHere you can get their second album:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3390962","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:273776f4deb07f21256e6dbb4b36906dd2e0da5c","amp;dn":"Blind+Dog+-+The+Last+Adventures+Of+Captain+Dog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"273776f4deb07f21256e6dbb4b36906dd2e0da5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,55,118,244,222,176,127,33,37,110,109,187,75,54,144,109,210,224,218,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
