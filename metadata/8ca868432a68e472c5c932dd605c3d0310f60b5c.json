Stimulus is sure to deliver! This is a movie made out of passion for the sport. Stimulus documents the skiing talent and off-snow antics of today's fearless skiers. Jamie Pierre, Jon Olsson, Rex Thomas, Heath Ordway, Gordy Piefer, Sage Cattabriga-Alosa, Ben Wheeler, Jack Hannan, Jon Johnston, Ian McIntosh and Ryan Oakden are just some of the skiers the film follows. &amp;quot;It's by far my best movie segment of the season, possibly ever,' said Jamie Pierre. &amp;quot;It's the only film that has my record cliff drop of 185 feet in Engelberg, Switzerland.&amp;quot; Rex Thomas said: &amp;quot;The movie is a super progressive blend of big mountain lines, terrain park shenanigans and back country boosters, put together with super innovative editing and creativity.&amp;quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ca868432a68e472c5c932dd605c3d0310f60b5c","amp;dn":"Stimulus+%282004%29+%5Bskidfilm%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ca868432a68e472c5c932dd605c3d0310f60b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,168,104,67,42,104,228,114,197,201,50,221,96,92,61,3,16,246,11,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
