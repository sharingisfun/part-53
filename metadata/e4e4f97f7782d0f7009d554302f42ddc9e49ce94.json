When a worker hangs himself after being falsely accused of thievery, the workers strike. At first, there&amp;#039;s excitement in workers&amp;#039; households and in public places as they develop their demands communally. Then, as the strike drags on and management rejects demands, hunger mounts, as does domestic and civic distress. Provocateurs recruited from the lumpen and in league with the police and the fire department bring problems to the workers; the spies do their dirty work; and, the military arrives to liquidate strikers.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nVisit  www.dvdquorum.es for more classic movies\n\nenjoy and dont forget to share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4e4f97f7782d0f7009d554302f42ddc9e49ce94","amp;dn":"Strike+-+Stachka+%281925%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4e4f97f7782d0f7009d554302f42ddc9e49ce94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,228,249,127,119,130,208,247,0,157,85,67,2,244,45,220,158,73,206,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
