Starring such illustrious Illuminati frontmen as Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Mao Tse Tung, this documentary leans heavily on original archive material to show how political leaders managed to manipulate public opinion to justify, support and embrace their murderous regimes.\n\nIt looks at major tragedies such as Stalin's purges, the forced collectivisation and famine in Ukraine in the 1930s, Hitler's propagation of racial hatred and sterilisation in Germany, Mao's cult of personality and the late 1950's mass starvation in China. It's not limited to long-gone dictatorships, though. Attempts to manipulate public opinion during the 1950s McCarthy communist witchhunt and the Vietnam War are also covered; the footage of the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising is particularly impressive &amp; shows how successful China has been in deflecting the world's attention from the massacre.\n\nThis may be about Big Lies of the 20th Century, but what it shows again and again is how, as Hitler recognised, &quot;It is easier to get the masses to believe in big lies than small ones&quot;. Hmmm... sound familiar?\n\n51min XVID (ffmpeg) 464x352 903kbps mp3 128kbps mono 44.1 kHz visit http://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33cb6e0980672821ff8645e10dabf4969a92e35b","amp;dn":"The+Big+Lies+of+the+Twentieth+Century.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33cb6e0980672821ff8645e10dabf4969a92e35b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,203,110,9,128,103,40,33,255,134,69,225,13,171,244,150,154,146,227,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
