After suffering deep gashes to her leg from an accidental fall, \nEsther (Marina de Van), a young research analyst, becomes preoccupied with her body and skin, \nespecially her wounds.  At first she merely caresses her arms, pinches her excess skin, or traces the cuts on her legs, but it \nisn't long before she is carving wounds directly and aggressively into her own body.  Her boyfriend (Laurent Lucas) becomes \nunderstandably concerned and angry, but his inability to understand forces Esther into reclusion to explore her newfound practice. \nWith increased urgency, she turns an unapologetic knife or razor upon her own skin.  Marina de Van, who not only stars but also \ndirected and wrote In My Skin, has long collaborated with Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Ozon, acting in See The Sea and Sitcom, and co-writing Under \nThe Sand and Eight Women.  With In My Skin, De Van joins a group of directors including David Cronenberg, Georges Franju and \nRoman Polanski who brilliantly imagine the physical manifestations of their character?s innermost torments.\n\ntrailer: http://www.wellspring.com/movies/trailer.html?page=trailer&amp;movie_id=24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nthis is my first up -this is my small contribution to say thanks for all the great things i have enjoyed here.\nhope you enjoy this film as much as i do. i've been searching forever for this film\nonline and surprisingly couldn't find it anywhere. hopefully others have been searching for it as well.not for the squeamish or faint of heart\n\nenjoy &amp; look for more interesting feature releases from me in the future.\n\n- adamanteus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe8781456cdf5a4fb48faae554ec208498f4354","amp;dn":"In+My+Skin+%28Dans+Ma+Peau%29+2002+adamant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe8781456cdf5a4fb48faae554ec208498f4354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,232,120,20,86,205,245,164,251,72,250,174,85,78,194,8,73,143,67,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
