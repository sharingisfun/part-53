Together, we have taken those requests, our own          \n   ideas, and the concept of a supercharged IDE and produced what we       \n   consider to be a powerful application with new and exciting features    \n   such as Native Support for over 30 popular compliers, Integrated CVS    \n   Version Control, built-in Class Browsing, Language Intelligence         \n   (like Intellisense), Project Converter, and a Batch Builder to name     \n   just a few.                                                             \n                                                                           \n   -Includes all the functionality of UltraEdit-32!                        \n   -Powerful Project/Solution support:                                     \n       Visual Studio to UEStudio Project conversion                        \n       Integrated Compiler Support                                         \n       Integrated CVS Support                                              \n       Integrated Tag Support                                              \n       Project Manager                                                     \n       Project Templates (compiler specific)                               \n   -Build functions:                                                       \n       Compile                                                             \n       Build/Batch Build                                                   \n       Debug                                                               \n       Run Application                                                     \n   -HTML Toolbar - PHP support:                                            \n       Run scripts                                                         \n       Check Syntax                                                        \n       Parse Document                                                      \n       Strip Comments                                                      \n       Highlight Source                                                    \n   -Enhanced Workspace Manager:                                            \n       ClassViewer                                                         \n       Resource Editor                                                     \n       Integrated Tags                                                     \n   -Language Intelligence:                                                 \n       IntelliTips                                                         \n       QuickTips                                                           \n       Function Tips                                                       \n   -Extended Toolbars:                                                     \n       Standard UltraEdit-32 Toolbar                                       \n       Build Toolbar                                                       \n       HTML Toolbar                                                        \n       IntelliTips Toolbar                                                 \n       Resource Editor Toolbar                                             \n       Tools Toolbar                                                       \n\n;--------------------------------\n; BiG RESPECT TO: TEAM BLZ\n;--------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b298683f8892104c818cd161eb203a14bde6212","amp;dn":"UEStudio.5.0.0%2BKeygen.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b298683f8892104c818cd161eb203a14bde6212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,41,134,131,248,137,33,4,200,24,205,22,30,178,3,161,75,222,98,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
