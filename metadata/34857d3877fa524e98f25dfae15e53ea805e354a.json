The resulting song or \n        loop  can  be  exported to a WAV/MP3 file and all MIDI events can \n        be exported to a standard MIDI file. \n                  \n        FL  Studio  is  a pattern based sequencer, which means you create \n        your  songs in pieces (patterns) using the Step Sequencer and the \n        Piano  Roll  view  and  then weld those pieces together using the \n        Playlist  window  (the Playlist also supports full-featured audio \n        tracks  with  hardrrive streaming). Then you can add a wide range \n        of  effects  to  your  instruments (reverb, phaser, flanger etc.) \n        and  route  the  resulting  mixer  tracks  in any way you like to \n        create complex mixing chains with ease.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34857d3877fa524e98f25dfae15e53ea805e354a","amp;dn":"Image+Line+Fruity+Loops+Studio+XXL+v5+0+2-H2O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34857d3877fa524e98f25dfae15e53ea805e354a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,133,125,56,119,250,82,78,152,242,93,250,225,94,83,234,128,94,53,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
