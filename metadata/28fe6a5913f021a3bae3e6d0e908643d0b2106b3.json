Also, a comment is always welcome!\nOf course I encourage anyone to share this unaltered\nrelease in DC rar hubs or whatever since I've \nfollowed the scene rules.\n\n// AssMaster @ The Pirate Bay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28fe6a5913f021a3bae3e6d0e908643d0b2106b3","amp;dn":"Escape.From.L.A.iNTERNAL.1996.DVDRip.XViD-AssMaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28fe6a5913f021a3bae3e6d0e908643d0b2106b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,254,106,89,19,240,33,163,186,227,230,208,233,8,100,61,11,33,6,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
