Along the way, they meet up with some friends, including Willam, a guy who stares at Magic Eye pictures, desprately trying to see the hidden image; Gwen, one of TS's ex-girlfriends; and Jay &amp; Silent Bob, of Clerks fame. Eventually, they decide to try and win back their significant others, and take care of their respective nemesises (TS's girlfriend's father, and a store clerk who hates the two for not having any shopping agenda) with a hair brained scheme and the assistance of Jay and Silent Bob.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8747f8848acdedc2b4cb83e6d7bd1841f833037","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+-+Mallrats+WS+%28Switchable+Movie+Audio+and+Commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8747f8848acdedc2b4cb83e6d7bd1841f833037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,116,127,136,72,172,222,220,43,76,184,62,109,123,209,132,31,131,48,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
