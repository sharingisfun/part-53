In one case, a belly dancer can summon a tidal wave of '57 Chevy cars to knock her foe on his back. Together with their Stands, characters can even double-team opponents, racking up lots of hits with relatively little effort.\n\nEach fighter has his or her own back-story culled from the anime series, and a super story mode forces players to switch characters as the plot unfolds. While JoJo's might not have the depth of other Capcom games, it certainly makes up for its simplicity with an unmistakably odd and fast-paced style. --Robb Guido\n\nPros:\nColorful anime graphics\nAddictive gameplay\n\nCons:\nSimplistic controls might deter veterans\n\nThis is the Import NTSC (Japanese) Version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b433da7075e322f509136a1cfe2e07535de37633","amp;dn":"JoJo%5C%27s+Bizarre+Adventure+%5BPSX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b433da7075e322f509136a1cfe2e07535de37633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,51,218,112,117,227,34,245,9,19,106,28,254,46,7,83,93,227,118,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
