He and his brother had separate groups. Tom's band, Spider Webb and the Insects, signed a recording contract with Del-Fi Records but broke up in 1959 before releasing any records. John's band, The Blue Velvets, began backing Tom, and eventually Tom joined John's band, and the group made three singles for Orchestra Records in 1961 and 1962, with Tom as lead singer. In the mid-1960s, the group was called The Golliwogs and recorded with Fantasy Records, with Tom and John sharing lead vocal duties. By 1968 the band was renamed Creedence Clearwater Revival, and John had become full-time lead singer and primary songwriter. During the few years of the life of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Tom sang back up vocals and wrote songs, but only one of his songs (&quot;Walk on the Water&quot;) was recorded. This lack of opportunity, along with festering, longstanding animosity with his brother, led him to leave CCR in 1971.\n\nAfter the band broke up, Fogerty began performing and recording solo. Although John Fogerty played several guitar parts on Tom's solo-albums, they remained estranged. Tom was bitter at having his contributions overlooked. In the pre-CCR days, Tom had been singer, songwriter, and, generally, manager of the act. Tom Fogerty recorded with Fantasy Records in 1971. His first solo album, &quot;Tom Fogerty,&quot; reached #78 on the album charts. On this album, Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders played on some of the sessions, and the 1973 follow up album, &quot;Zephyr National,&quot; had Stu Cook and Doug Clifford (from CCR), as well as John Fogerty, performing on it.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, Tom continued to record, and all former members of Creedence Clearwater Revival were increasingly resentful and angry at John Fogerty. John Fogerty claimed all royalties and sued Fantasy Records. When Tom re-signed with Fantasy, John broke from his brother famously and bitterly (viz. John Fogerty's &quot;Vanz Kant Danz&quot;).\n\nTom Fogerty died of AIDS, probably due to blood transfusions during treatment for back ailments, and John refused to be at his bedside or reconcile at the end.
