Sound does lag at times though.&lt;/font&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4609ba324fc402c960a67ea7a576b34055e9169","amp;dn":"Project+64-X+276+Roms+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4609ba324fc402c960a67ea7a576b34055e9169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,96,155,163,36,252,64,44,150,10,103,234,122,87,107,52,5,94,145,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
