Hairy Mary's is the club Slipknot came up in, and these guys are big fans so they flew to Des Moines to do a show at Slipknot's home club. Other than two shows they played here, I think they're pretty unknown outside of Japan. They put on a great show and had a lot of fun getting drunk and crazy afterwards. Hope you enjoy. \n\nhttp://homepage3.nifty.com/gunship666/\n\n1. CHAIN'CHANGE\n2. DEATH DISK\n3. FLAGSHIP 666\n4.
