But the\nblame was not Bela&amp;#039;s, but Curt&amp;#039;s. Siodmak knew going in that Lugosi was playing the monster and that the monster&amp;#039;s brain had been replaced with Ygor&amp;#039;s--and Ygor had a Hungarian accent. The truth of the matter is that Siodmak could not write dialect to save his soul--his dialog for Ilona Massey (Bela&amp;#039;s fellow Hungarian) is also curiously flat and lifeless. They cut Bela&amp;#039;s lines to appease Siodmak--a rather recalcitrant person to work with, from all reports--but obviously couldn&amp;#039;t cut Ilona&amp;#039;s as well. All they succeeded in doing was muddying the movie and insulting Bela&amp;#039;s fans. Good job, Curt! As for Eddie Parker, darn right he doubled for Lugosi in the action scenes. Bela was around 60 at this point and not a stunt-trained actor. Actors half his age didn&amp;#039;t do a lot of their own stunts, much less actors who also had severe back problems and resultant sciatica.\n\nThis film also marks the beginning of the &quot;whiny lycanthrope&quot; period of Chaney&amp;#039;s career. All he had to do was confine himself when the moon was full and his life would otherwise be pretty normal. Instead, we get the &quot;I just wanna die&quot; moaning we will have to endure through several more films. Curiously, I thin this may have had an impact on Chaney&amp;#039;s personal outlook as well; his career and life was just as much of a downward spiral as Bela&amp;#039;s. Bela had his pills and Lon had his bottle.\n\n\nDATA OF THE DVD\n\nAUDIO (CODEC): 2.0 Mono\n\nFORMAT (PAL O NTSC): Pal\n\nLANGUAGES: EspaÃƒÂ±ol, InglÃƒÂ©s, Italiano\n\nSUBS: EspaÃƒÂ±ol, InglÃƒÂ©s, PortuguÃƒÂ©s, Croata, Italiano\n\n\nIMAGE: FullFrame 1.33:1\n\nEXTRAS: interactive menu, Theatrical trailer, Direct access to scene\n\nRIPP METOD\n\nFORMATO: DVD5 =&gt; DVD5\n\nCOMPRESION: Without Compression\n\n\nRIPPED ....
