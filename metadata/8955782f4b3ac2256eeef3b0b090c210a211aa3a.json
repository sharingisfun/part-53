Led by William (Henry Thomas), they plan to rob a bank that is temporarily storing a cache of Confederate gold. The rest of the group includes Sam (Patrick Fugit), Todd (Isaiah Washington), Annabelle (Nicki Aycox), Clyde (Michael Shannon) and Joseph (Mark Boone Junior). But when the robbery results in a bloodbath, the six flee the town, aiming for Mexico. Threat of an impending thunderstorm makes the outlaws take shelter at a nearby isolated and presumed deserted plantation house. As the night wears on, each member of the group begins to have visions of the atrocities that occurred within the house. As the fear in the group begins to grow and the supernatural forces in the house start to manifest themselves, the six turn on each other and exact the wrath of the souls trapped alongside them.\n\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377749/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8955782f4b3ac2256eeef3b0b090c210a211aa3a","amp;dn":"Dead.Birds.2004.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8955782f4b3ac2256eeef3b0b090c210a211aa3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,85,120,47,75,58,194,37,110,238,243,176,176,144,194,16,162,17,170,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
