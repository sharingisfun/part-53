Before Weather dies, he gives Tom a notebook\nfilled with mysterious numbers, asking him to pass it on to his daughter. Taking\nthis assignment to heart, Tom puts himself and his wife at ever greater, more\npointless risk as he tries to deliver the notebook. Soon the Broadbents find\nthemselves the target of the prospector's assassin ÃƒÂ¹- a jailbird hired by an evil\nBritish paleontologist seeking the perfectly preserved remains of a\nTyrannosaurus rexÃƒÂ¹as well as a rogue government operative who's trying, with a\ncommandeered army squad, to kill almost everyone in the book. Lively yet\nridiculous, the narrative loses all plausibility as it becomes clear that the\ncharacters do what they do solely in order to keep the plot churning to its\nconclusion. The recent real-life discovery of a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil\ncontaining soft tissue makes this particularly timely. \n**** Publishers Weekly  \n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nEnjoy it!
