They were downloaded from nfl.com&amp;#039;s Field Pass in Real Media format and \nconverted to MP3. I split the files up into approximately 1 hour segments for \neasier navigation. The recordings are obviously not CD quality, but they are \nonly voice recordings anyway. Also, since this is raw footage from nfl.com,\nnothing has been edited. The gaps throughout the recordings are spaces where\nthe commercials were.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f27434d65ceb72bbb607ed5f27b00907b9e22d","amp;dn":"2006+Steelers+Playoff+Radio+Broadcasts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f27434d65ceb72bbb607ed5f27b00907b9e22d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,242,116,52,214,92,235,114,187,182,7,237,95,39,176,9,7,185,226,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
