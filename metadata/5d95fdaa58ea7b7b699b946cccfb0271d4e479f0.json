And the similarities don't stop there...\n\nTalking Heads frontman, iconoclast and owner of the eclectic Luaka Bop record\nlabel David Byrne even seems to be at a loss when trying to define what made\nGeggy Tah so intriguing during an all too brief heyday, stating simply it's\n&quot;like nothing you've ever heard before.&quot;\n\nSo what was it about the music Greg Kurstin and Tommy Jordan were making back\nin the mid-nineties that so amazed one of the most unique voices in modern\nmusic? Was it the cacaphony of diverse influence struggling to keep one step\nahead of Geggy Tah once they got going - or was it the heart rending honesty\nand world weary optimisim that made Geggy Tah such the conundrum?\n\nLike Byrne said, Geggy Tah is indeed unlike anything you've ever heard before\nbut there's a catch - flowing within this stream of novel sound there lies a\nwealth of familiar warmth, insider nods and interpritive exploration of our\ncollective musical history, all coming from a very left of center base.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Tracklist\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01  Granddad's Opening Address \t\n02  Whoever You Are \t \t\n03  Lotta Stuff \t \t\n04  Century Plant 2000 \t \t\n05  Sacred Cow \t \t\n06  House Of Usher (Inside) \t \t\n07  Don't Close The Door \t\n08  Such A Beautiful NIght \t\n09  She Withers \t\n10  Las Vegas With The Lights Out \t\n11  Mem \t\n12  Shed \t\n13  Gina\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d95fdaa58ea7b7b699b946cccfb0271d4e479f0","amp;dn":"Geggy+Tah+-+Sacred+Cow+%281996%29++256k+CBR+Rip+by+GOG-AD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d95fdaa58ea7b7b699b946cccfb0271d4e479f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,149,253,170,88,234,123,123,105,155,148,108,204,251,2,113,212,228,121,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
