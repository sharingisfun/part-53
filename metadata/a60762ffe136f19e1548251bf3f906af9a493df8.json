There is a clear cut line of change where this scenery takes over &amp; the FS2004 default stops...like the IndyLite scenery there is a lot of green n this 1. I just didn&amp;#039;t see that it was as well defined as the images show it to be.\n\nI have hte feeling that the images were done with a 19.2 mesh from FSprojects. I tried to install an old FSGenesis mesh that I had but it didn&amp;#039;t work too well....it was a file I had forever &amp; may have actually been made for FS2002.\n\nI was disappointed , but then with all the installing &amp; uninstalling of stuff it may just be time for a format &amp; reinstall of FS2004.\n\nPlease post your thoughts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a60762ffe136f19e1548251bf3f906af9a493df8","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Grand+Canyon+Photoreal.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a60762ffe136f19e1548251bf3f906af9a493df8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,7,98,255,225,54,241,158,21,72,37,27,243,249,6,175,154,73,61,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
