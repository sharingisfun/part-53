Philippe Noiret plays a grizzled old projectionist who takes pride in his presentation of screen dreams for a town still recovering from World War II. When a child (Jacques Perrin) demonstrates fascination not only for movies but also for the process of showing them to an audience, a lifelong friendship is struck. This isn't just one of those films for people who are already in love with the cinema. But if you are one of those folks, the emotional resonance between the action in Tornatore's world and the images on Noiret's screen will seem all the greater--and the finale all the more powerful.\n\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/catnumber.fcd098/number.1/qx/screens.htm\n\nHoppas att det skall falla er i smaken...
