Fucking hilarious\n\n\n\n&quot;This show brings two spiteful, jaded, and demented observers of humankind head-to-head in direct competition for a case of Miller Genuine Draft. In their critically acclaimed weekly podcast, award-winning broadcasters D. Simon and Lance Wackerle discuss the most vile, disquieting, and oddly amusing news items for your listening pleasure&quot;\n\n&quot;The most foul thing I have ever heard.
