While Ellis and Kessel have three unaccompanied duets, the inclusion of Byrd (thought of as a Brazilian specialist rather than a bopper) is the wild card that makes this set a major success. While Byrd is excellent on his features &amp;quot;Charlie's Blues&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;O Barquinho,&amp;quot; it is the three stomps featuring all the guitarists (&amp;quot;Undecided,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Topsy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Benny's Bugle&amp;quot;) that are most memorable.\n\n\n\n1 Undecided Robin, Shavers 6:48\nComposed by: Robin, Shavers\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis, Johnny Rae\n\n\n2 O Barquinho Boscoli, Menescal 4:54\nComposed by: Boscoli, Menescal\nPerformed by: Byrd, Johnny Rae, Joe Byrd\n\n\n3 Slow Burn Kessel 5:40\nComposed by: Kessel\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis, Johnny Rae\n\n\n4 Charlie's Blues Byrd 8:30\nComposed by: Byrd\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Johnny Rae, Joe Byrd\n\n\n5 Topsy Battle, Durham 6:46\nComposed by: Battle, Durham\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis, Johnny Rae\n\n\n6 Latin Groove Kessel 4:52\nComposed by: Kessel\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis\n\n\n7 Down Home Blues Ellis, Kessel 4:04\nComposed by: Ellis, Kessel\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis\n\n\n8 H and B Guitar Boogie Ellis, Kessel 4:18\nComposed by: Ellis, Kessel\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis\n\n\n9 Benny's Bugle Goodman 7:11\nComposed by: Goodman\nPerformed by: Byrd, Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis, Johnny Rae","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd215c40e8aa5d4bc17f996287fc80cbd27d413","amp;dn":"The+Great+Guitars+at+Charlies+Georgetown%28kessel%2Cbyrd%26ellis%2966mb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd215c40e8aa5d4bc17f996287fc80cbd27d413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,210,21,196,14,138,165,212,188,23,249,150,40,127,200,12,189,39,212,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
