Unfortunate, because he is also a famous dragon hunter who would like nothing better to put Mink's head on a wall. Her main goal is to find a potion that will make her completely human and will do just about anything that will give her a chance at it. High in slapstick humor and action, this series follows Mink as she pursues that potion and is pursued in turn by the dragon hunter.\n\nGenres\tAction, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy\nYear Published\t1993","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7788a088fd1d165eaaea61325858a52dcd848f71","amp;dn":"%5BP-A%5DDragon+Half%28SUB.DUB%29+-+Episode+1.ogm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7788a088fd1d165eaaea61325858a52dcd848f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,136,160,136,253,29,22,94,170,234,97,50,88,88,165,45,205,132,143,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
