Meanwhile, London becomes the Hellgate to the underworld and we lose control of time in TimeShift. But have no fear, for the video game industry will never be taken down by mere shifts in time and gates of hell, as evidenced by Midway bringing Arcade Treasures to the PSP, and Criterion delivering their first entry into the world of shooters with Black.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16edb4a98024695c29a0f943e6b19365b42fa4b1","amp;dn":"electric_playground+15x12.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16edb4a98024695c29a0f943e6b19365b42fa4b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,237,180,169,128,36,105,92,41,160,249,67,230,177,147,101,180,47,164,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
