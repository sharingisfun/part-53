THIS TIME EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OK!\n\n\nThe inspiring story of the team that transcended its sport and united a nation with a new feeling of hope. Based on the true story of one of the greatest moments in sports history, the tale captures a time and place where differences could be settled by games and a cold war could be put on ice. In 1980, the United States Ice Hockey team's coach, Herb Brooks, took a ragtag squad of college kids up against the legendary juggernaut from the Soviet Union at the Olympic Games. Despite the long odds, Team USA carried the pride of a nation yearning from a distraction from world events. With the world watching the team rose to the occasion, prompting broadcaster Al Michaels' now famous question, to the millions viewing at home: Do you believe in miracles? Yes! \n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349825/ \n\nAudio: English \n\nSubs: English, French and Spanish (yes, this one is coming from Spain!). Out of sincere appreciation for this Swedish web site and everybody collaborating, I have added Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Norwegian subs. \n\nFirst torrent upload. I hope everything's OK. \n\nAny comments in English please. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd47ce6ff9f3383efe9b6eb53847a3bce53aae6d","amp;dn":"MIRACLE+%28subs+for+everybody%29+-++2ND+UPLOAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd47ce6ff9f3383efe9b6eb53847a3bce53aae6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,71,206,111,249,243,56,62,254,155,110,181,56,71,163,188,229,58,174,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
