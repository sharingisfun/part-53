Here you go my old time china.\n\nYeah, this is another Beta 2 encode.  The shit's amazing, especially with all of the pre-processing on.  Good movie, although odd.  Get your fix for jewish punk rock.  Features The Ramones as The Ramones.\n\nNO MORE REQUESTS.  I can't fucking keep up anymore.  Sorry.  Let's just trust that I have good taste, and that you'll get your movie eventually.  I have some movies that I feel need to be seen...\n\nThe only way I am doing another request for a while, is *IF* I already have the movie encoded, and have it archived.  So feel free to ask.  If I have it made already, I'll throw it online.  If not: Tough titty said the kitty when the milk went dry.\n\nNOTICE:\n\nThere is a NEW version of XviD 1.1.0 out. If you have XviD 1.1.0, you most likely have BETA 1. You need to download and install BETA 2.
