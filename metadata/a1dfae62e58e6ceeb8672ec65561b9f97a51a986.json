It's just about the most crazy dub job I've ever seen.  \n\nIt appears that Joey Lauren Adams from Mallrats, and the rest of Kevin Smith's films does one of the female voices...you'll hear it for sure.\n\nIvo asked me to hard encode the subtitles, but I was already into my second pass using an athlon 750, so I ripped the subtitles via OCR instead as an external .SRT pack...it's very easy to use...it even works under windows media player...just turn on subtitles, and make sure the .SRT pack is in the same dir, and named the same name, as the main .avi you are watching.\n\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0\nBitrate: 897 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x368 = 1.74:1\nAudio: English (Dubbed), 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: External English (Optional)\nRuntime: 01:35:09\n\n--------\n\nNext torrent up, ALSO for IVO:\n\nThe well known JAP Film: Wild Zero\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267116/\n\nFeaturing:\n\nHard Encoded English Subs, JAP Audio\n\n\n-----\n\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on\n(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, turn it off. I don't want another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync because they are totally computer illiterate.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1dfae62e58e6ceeb8672ec65561b9f97a51a986","amp;dn":"Bio+Zombie+%28xvid110-sickboy88%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1dfae62e58e6ceeb8672ec65561b9f97a51a986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,223,174,98,229,142,108,238,184,103,46,198,85,97,185,249,122,81,169,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
