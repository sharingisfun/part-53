(Denmark) to European movements\n\nThe Danish association ?Rebellion? appeals to all European movements for democracy and international solidarity to join it in challenging national anti-terrorist legislations, the ?terrorist list? of the European Union, and the so-called ?international war on terror?.\n\nThrough present anti-terrorist legislation, European states have attempted to curb the freedom of expression and the political rights of their citizens, including their right to extend moral and material support to resistance and liberation movements.\n\nIn the past year ?Rebellion? has publicly, and in direct conflict with Danish anti-terrorism legislation, transferred substantial funds to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). An important criterion for our choice of organizations is that they seek to further secular, democratic, and humanist goals.\n\nThe Danish Ministry of Justice and police authorities have as yet not raised criminal charges against ?Rebellion?. In order to further such a step, both the Colombian ambassador to the Nordic countries and vice-president Santos have had talks with officials from the Ministry of Justice and the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen.\n\nWe appeal to other European organizations to join us in a continuing challenge to European anti-terrorist legislation and the ?terrorist list? of the European Union.\n\nWe envisage the following elements in the campaign:\n\n- Collection of funds within each country with list of those willing to stand forward as signatories. It would be inadvisable to open accounts, as these may be subject to seizure.\n\n- A goal of at least 100 signatories and at least 1000 Euro within each participating country should be set. Involving prominent citizens in the initiative would be of great advantage.\n\n- Publication of the initiative within each country when these goals are met, or at whatever time seems appropriate within the national context.\n\n- Conference of all participating organizations to be held in Copenhagen, perhaps in November, where a collective transfer of funds to resistance and liberation movements is announced.\n\n- Publication of a conference manifesto on the so-called ?war on terror?, reiterating solidarity with the international struggle against illegitimate state power and foreign occupation.\n\nWe hope that this appeal will be welcomed by your organization, and that the initiative will be taken up and developed in as daring a manner as possible within each national context.\n\n\nThe association ?Rebellion? can be contacted at following postal address:\nForeningen Opror\nC/O Blaagaardens Medborgerhus\nBlaagaards Plads 3\n2200 Copenhagen N\nDenmark,\nOr at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e716e6c716c5e7277706b66737f777230716c79&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nOur website is at www.opror.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9f955d132a400fd55504f2cb31c139777586ba","amp;dn":"%28Banned%29+appeal+from+%3FRebellion%3F+%28Opror%2C+Denmark%29+to+European+mo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9f955d132a400fd55504f2cb31c139777586ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,159,149,93,19,42,64,15,213,85,4,242,203,49,193,57,119,117,134,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
