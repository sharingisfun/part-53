It&amp;#039;s straight from the original cassette which was bought in Gothenburg. I did some internet searching and can find no mention of this cassette anywhere, and the guy I got it from said that it was &amp;#039;probably only ever issued in Gothenburg since NO ONE knows about it.&amp;#039; He also &amp;#039;tried to make the sound better&amp;#039;... not quite sure what that means, but other than being recorded a little hot (especially the vocals), it sounds amazing. I tracked this in Wavelab (it was a single file), applied some Waves X-Click to reduce the digital noise from the overdriven vocals, and normalized the show down to 97% to reduce clipping. I would rate this an A- soundwise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3375dfcab6972c14142336f4fd23b056788da1b","amp;dn":"Anti+Cimex+-+Live+In+Sweden+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3375dfcab6972c14142336f4fd23b056788da1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,55,93,252,171,105,114,193,65,66,51,111,79,210,59,5,103,136,218,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
