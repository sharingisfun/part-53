As the hauntingly beautiful old city of Saigon fades into the shadows of neon lights, Coca Cola signs, plastic lotus flowers, and other symbols of the Western invasion, these characters' paths begin to cross. \nStories merge to paint a portrait of a country in transition, the last moments of a culture which, through a second invasion by its former enemy, will never be the same again; Kien An is a living memory of the old ways, living a life seemingly unchanged by the passage of time; Lan has reinvented herself as someone who can survive in the cold-hearted capitalist world; Hai bridges the two worlds on his cyclo; James Hager is a reminder of the country's ravaged past; and young Woody is a symbol of its future. \n\n\n[pre]\n\n   IMDB-link......: http://imdb.com/title/tt0138874/\n   Source.........: Retail DVD5 [WideSight]\n   Screen format..: Full Screen\n   Audio Language.: Vietnamese\n                                                                                \n   Subtitles......: English / Chinese\n                   \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1caac92837e5cd343ab36f2426899ee860534490","amp;dn":"THREE.SEASONS.DVDrip.WRINK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1caac92837e5cd343ab36f2426899ee860534490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,170,201,40,55,229,205,52,58,179,111,36,38,137,158,232,96,83,68,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
