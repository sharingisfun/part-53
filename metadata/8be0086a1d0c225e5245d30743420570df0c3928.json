Lets face it. The default vbulletin, IPB, phpBB skins / templates /styles are nice but not the most appealing. They work fine and serve their purpose but we aim to make our skins look like you paid hundreds of dollars customizing your board. The best thing is you don't have to spend that much money :)\n\nAlso ALL the skins come with layered .psd files that you can edit and use on your website. That's right. We give you the rights to use the graphics on your actual website, not just your board!\n\nOne other benefit is the minute your payment has been completed you are sent an email with a download link. So the delivery is instant (only PayPal echecks are not instant). No waiting... You pay and you get your product with no hassle. The only time you will ever have to contact us is if you purchased an installation option. But even then you still get your product/files instantly! If you prefer phpBB or IPB skins then you will be glad to know that you get FREE updates for 1 year on any skin purchased!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be0086a1d0c225e5245d30743420570df0c3928","amp;dn":"eXtremepixels+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be0086a1d0c225e5245d30743420570df0c3928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,224,8,106,29,12,34,94,82,69,211,7,67,66,5,112,223,12,57,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
