You can probably figure out the rest by yourself, but I should warn\n you that the story doesn&amp;#039;t play out the way you might think. Also, all this is subject to editor revision.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9143ff16f4e89fe1a6fbf997ab5e0f525e380b00","amp;dn":"Indomitable+by+Terry+Brooks%2C+Shannara+short+story+from+Legends2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9143ff16f4e89fe1a6fbf997ab5e0f525e380b00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,67,255,22,244,232,159,225,166,251,249,151,171,94,15,82,94,56,11,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
