Burn the iso, put it into your xbox and\n        be very amazed... Next, think of the posibilities of hacking\n        this little demo disc that we might start running code on\n        the retail xbox 360's ! :)\n        So the second task is done. We hope this encourages all hackers,\n        coders and crackers out there to take up the challenge.\n        Enjoy!\n        \n        Special note to the Clear kids: Yes, we are old and lazy, and no,\n        we are not going to do some scene war against you. Life is too\n        short for that, and our dicks are allready large enough :)\n        \n        Keep up the hard work!\n                  Pi Putting the 360' Spin on the Xbox :-)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29435faa4f340d3ac45e23c73ab63d8718e4beee","amp;dn":"EXPERIENCE+XBOX+360+%2ASELFBOOTING%2A+DISC%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29435faa4f340d3ac45e23c73ab63d8718e4beee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,67,95,170,79,52,13,58,196,94,35,199,58,182,61,135,24,228,190,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
