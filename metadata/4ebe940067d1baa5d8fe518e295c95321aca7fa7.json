(Note the non-existant exclamation point. Sloppy)\n\n-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-\n\t&quot;New York City is terrorized by a series of brutal mutilation murders. The public is outraged, because it's discovered that the killer is a cop! Innocent policemen, are killed by the panic stricken public. The city itself is in an uproar. Will New York rid itself of this deadly menace...MANIAC COP?&quot;\n\n-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-\n\tUnseen cop kills people. Bruce Campbell gets framed. Then beaten up. Then hit around some. Then the rest of the cast proceed to display the acting that won this film the Academy Award for 1988.\n\n-Notes-\nHot off Evil Dead 2, Bruce Campbell takes on what is the most serious and demanding role of his career. Without an ounce of humor or slapstick, how will The Chin stop this Maniac Cop! From the writer of Phone Booth, Cellular, and Q: The Winged Serpent, MANIAC COP is a gritty  portrayal of the true problems that plague the NYPD every day!\n\n\nThis movie is actually available on DVD somewhere, but is a challenge to track down, probably OOP, hence this VHS version. If anyone has the DVD version, by all means  upload it so we can get rid of this shitty version. Long live cheese!\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Maniac.Cop.VHSCapture.LRH.avi\nFilesize.....: 687 MB (or 703,660 KB or 720,547,840 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:25:24 (153,559 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1085 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-2 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 32 kb/s, monophonic CBR \nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\n\n*QUESTIONS*\nWhy is the resolution so small?\n...That's as high as my capture card will go.
