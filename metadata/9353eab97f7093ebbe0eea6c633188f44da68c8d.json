What would happen if the world&amp;#039;s oil supply dried up overnight?\n\nDirected by StÃƒÂ©phane Meunier and starring Hippolyte Girardot, Gwendoline Hamon and Helena Noguerra, this program is a docudrama based on the idea that oil companies, having vastly overstated their oil reserves to keep their value high, are faced with a wave of terrorist attacks aimed at jeopardising supply to the West. Reluctantly, they have to own up with the fact there&amp;#039;s only two years of supply left.\n\nInterviews with scientists, economists, environmentalists and Green politicians alternate with dramatisations following the life of greedy stockbroker Paul. He has invested 90 per cent of his company&amp;#039;s shares in oil and watches with glee as the price of petrol skyrockets, until his professional and personal life are directly affected as a disastrous recession hits the oil-dependent world.\n\nCodec: Xvid\nFrame Size: 512x288\nVideo Bitrate: 800\nLanguage: Mainly French with English subtitles\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9353eab97f7093ebbe0eea6c633188f44da68c8d","amp;dn":"2013%3A+Oil+No+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9353eab97f7093ebbe0eea6c633188f44da68c8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,83,234,185,127,112,147,235,190,14,234,108,99,49,136,244,77,166,140,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
