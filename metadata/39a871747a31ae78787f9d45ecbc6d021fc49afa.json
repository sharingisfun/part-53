It&amp;#039;s a story of strange, impossible, inexplicable love between a Muslim Bulgarian woman and a non-Muslim Bulgarian man. Ivan (the Bulgarian) is a pure and romantic young fellow, who gets caught up in the so-called &quot;regeneration process&quot; (when ethnic Turks&amp;#039; names were forcibly changed to Bulgarian ones). He is responsible for the official seals, which is required to issue the new identity documents after the forced name changes. The schoolteacher Ayten tries to steal the seals, thinking that this way she can slow down the ethnic genocide. Their unexpected and unusual meeting brings these two characters together and makes them fell close, forcing Ivan to take a fateful decision -he must either &quot;rename&quot; Ayten, or face the consequences if he does not. Later on fate bring them together once again. Ayten&amp;#039;s small child is killed during an action by the special forces. Ivan, who has been among the main participants of this action is paralyzed with shock. The security forces decide to &quot;erase&quot; his memory. Ayten is also put in isolation, in the same hospital. From death, which is the only choice left to each of them, comes the common past of Ayten and Ivan. They gradually overcome their animosity; accept their differences and draw towards each other. But will the people around them accept their choice? Happy ending are a rarity in the Balkans. Then Ayteh&amp;#039;s brother returns from Turkey...\n\nRuntime: ~110 min\nVideo: 640x464, 25fps, XviD codec, ~1600kbps\nAudio: MPEG Layer-3 codec, 48kHz, 128kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a871747a31ae78787f9d45ecbc6d021fc49afa","amp;dn":"Otkradnati+Ochi+%28Stolen+Eyes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a871747a31ae78787f9d45ecbc6d021fc49afa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,168,113,116,122,49,174,120,120,127,157,69,236,188,109,2,31,196,154,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
