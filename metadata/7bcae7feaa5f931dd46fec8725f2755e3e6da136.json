And let me tell you it's well worth the wait, TWILIGHT come away as the best keep secret in Metal.\n\nWhat with this gem and their other release &quot;The Edge&quot; being two ass-kicking albums of extremely heavy, dark Progressive Metal with lots of crunch to those guitars and the keyboards adding a nice atmospheric element to the sound (has to be heard to be believed). Organizations like this, whether anybody gets to hear them or not, fill the void left by old TAD MOROSE and CONCEPTION. Lead Screamer Anders Engberg is a dead ringer for Kristian AndrÃƒÂ©n (TAD MOROSE, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, FIFTH REASON), never allowing you to believe he was once in LIONS SHARE. His vocals are some of the best I've heard in Metal, they are that damn good. \n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bcae7feaa5f931dd46fec8725f2755e3e6da136","amp;dn":"Twilight+-+Eye+For+An+Eye+%28Danish+Progressive+Metal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bcae7feaa5f931dd46fec8725f2755e3e6da136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,202,231,254,170,95,147,29,212,111,236,135,37,242,117,94,62,109,161,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
