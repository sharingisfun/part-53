The angel Gabriel must school Joseph to accept Mary's pregnancy, while Mary comes to terms with God's plan through meditations that are sometimes angry and usually punctuated by elemental images of the sun, moon, clouds, flowers, and water. Godard intercuts a brief parallel story of Eva and her nameless lover; their adulterous affair, rife with philosophical discussions, leads nowhere. \n\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\nSpanish\nPortuguese\n\n\nLanguage:\nFrench\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba0494e5a3459176b3b50ed224705d8be48f39fc","amp;dn":"Je+Vous+Salue+Marie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba0494e5a3459176b3b50ed224705d8be48f39fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,4,148,229,163,69,145,118,179,181,14,210,36,112,93,139,228,143,57,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
