The best tracks here -- &amp;quot;Unconsciously Screamin',&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Jesus Shootin' Heroin,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;One Million, Billionth of a Millisecond on a Sunday Morning&amp;quot; -- rival anything in the group's catalog, while even the weaker selections still suggest a truly original musical vision in embryo. Complete with a batch of unreleased covers making the set as valuable to longtime fans as more recent converts, A Collection of Songs proves once and for all that the Lips didn't simply become a great band overnight -- they always had it in them, with the best still yet to come.\n\n1.
