No Fun At All were one of the best bands to come out Sweden, if you like Bad Religion or No Use For A Name etc then you will love them. The Donots are a great live band from Germany, they are mixture of skate punk, Beatsteaks, Autopilot Off etc. I will be posting full TV shows by both bands soon, so this is a chance to check them out first, enjoy!\n\nNo Fun At All-Taubertal Festival German TV 2000 SVCD 22 Minutes\nDonots-Taubertal Festival German TV 12th August 2001 SVCD 23 Minutes                                      \n                      \nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy.
