This is really well filmed and the guy that shot it is one of the few people i ever traded videos with who could actually film well. He also filmed the 7 Seconds show i posted. This is a great show and is a must for all punks who like truly amazing punk rock, it's hard to describe Samiam for those who don't know them. This isn't your shouting screaming punk rock but more thoughtful emotional punk rock(Not Emo)more in the tradition of The Only Ones, Chron Gen, New Model Army, Jawbreaker. I highly recommend this to everyone, enjoy!\n\nSamiam-The Abyss Houston Texas 2nd October 1994 SVCD 49 Minutes\n\nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin &amp;amp; cue files.
