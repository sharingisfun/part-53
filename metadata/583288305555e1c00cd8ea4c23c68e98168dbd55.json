The original is in Betamax format , and I have now converted it to a nice SVCD format. It's in two .mpg files, and you can either burn it to a CD-R or just watch on your computer. As far as I know it was never released commercially. This is primo golden age Flipper!\n\nThe show alternates between Flipper playing live in a TV studio, and then being interviewed. If you're into Flipper, this is great stuff. They do a lot of their classics like Sex Bomb, Way of the World\n\nClip # 1: \n\n1. Way of the World\n2. In Life My Friends\n3. Sacrifice\n4. Interview #1\n5. (I Saw You) Shine\n6. Get Away\n7. Interview #2\n\nClip # 2: \n\n7. Interview #2 (continued)\n8. I Wanna Be With You ?????\n9. Sex Bomb\n\nEnjoy! Trade Only! Play Fair! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583288305555e1c00cd8ea4c23c68e98168dbd55","amp;dn":"FLIPPER+Live+in+the+Studio+1983+SVCD+color+video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583288305555e1c00cd8ea4c23c68e98168dbd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,50,136,48,85,85,225,192,12,216,234,76,35,198,142,152,22,141,189,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
