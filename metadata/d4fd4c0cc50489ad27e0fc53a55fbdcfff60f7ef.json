The punishing intensity of        \ntheir playing hasn't let up over the years, and the group           \nmembers clearly delight in playing some classic material. With      \nthe REIGN IN BLOOD album performed in its entirety, tracks such      \nas Angel of Death,Criminally Insane, and Jesus Saves come     \nto life once again. As an added bonus, Slayer also performs a        \nselection of other classics, including South of Heaven, War       \nEnsemble, and Mandatory Suicide.\nAs the group exits with blood-like rain falling on them, there can\nbe no doubt that they have entered the pantheon of classic metal bands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4fd4c0cc50489ad27e0fc53a55fbdcfff60f7ef","amp;dn":"Slayer-Still+Reigning-DVDA-2004-BUTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4fd4c0cc50489ad27e0fc53a55fbdcfff60f7ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,253,76,12,197,4,137,173,39,224,252,83,165,95,189,207,255,96,247,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
