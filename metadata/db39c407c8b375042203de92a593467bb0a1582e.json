As the novel begins, the indomitable Lucas Davenport (now happily\nmarried, a contented father and bored out of his mind) is slogging through the\nnorthern tundra of Broderick, Minn., to inspect the naked dangling corpses of a\nwhite woman and black man (&quot;They were frozen. Like Popsicles.&quot;) that have\nshocked the locals as well as Minnesota's governor with the ugly specter of a\nlynching. Davenport, now more or less a free agent for the state's Bureau of\nCriminal Apprehension (&quot;I kick people's asses&quot;), is unleashed by the governor,\ngiving Davenport and his scruffy sidekick, Del Capslock, a chance to escape\ntheir square city lives and catch the villain(s) while staving off the media\nvultures, Sandford's trademark subplot. As in previous novels, the original\ncrime (rendered in a truly horrific opening sequence) is merely the gateway to a\ndeeper, more insidious criminal enterprise, this one an international labyrinth\nof stolen cars, drugs, gambling and kidnapping. Some truly vicious familial\nmachinations in the small town contrast well with Davenport's staid and stable\nhome life. Another pleasant surprise is the precocious Letty West, whose\nawakening teenage sensibilities make an impression on Davenport. Sandford's\nusual background details (readers will learn how to run a muskrat trapline and\nhow an Indian casino operates) are deftly woven into the fabric. This latest\ninstallment in a series now a decade and a half old is vintage Sandford.\n* Publishers Weekly  \n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nEnjoy it!
