Remote workstations and laptops running KPF are protected from Internet born attacks.\n\nConnections overview\n\n\nNetwork security\nResiding on each desktop computer, Kerio Personal Firewall allows advanced users or network administrators to create packet filter rules that block or limit traffic for specific ports, protocols, or IP addresses, adding a level of control and security found in sophisticated network firewalls. Rules are based on the needs of individual users and the overall security requirements of the organization.\n\nPrivacy protection\nScanning for sensitive information, blocking pop-up windows, filtering out on-line banner ads, and restricting cookies and spyware programs that track browsing habits are functions of KPF that reduce the risk of identity theft and help make surfing the Internet much more pleasant.\n\nIntrusion detection\nPotential intruders use various techniques to find out whether a targeted computer is vulnerable to attack. These techniques vary from simple port scanning to more elaborate exploits. Kerio Personal Firewall has a built-in intrusion detection system that identifies and blocks most known attacks.\n\nApplication integrity\nBesides upgrades or updates, there is usually no need to modify an application. Some modifications can make your programs report usage information. Kerio Personal Firewall can keep applications from launching independently, being modified for malicious purposes, or starting other applications.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d82ce13e643efbbdf40e5fe42768feb96828b7","amp;dn":"kerio-personal-firewall-4+1+3-en-win+keygen-Lz0+rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d82ce13e643efbbdf40e5fe42768feb96828b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,216,44,225,62,100,62,251,189,244,14,95,228,39,104,254,185,104,40,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
