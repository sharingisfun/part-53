I never worked on them once saved\nin MP3, to keep the best quality possible, so this means that if I realized some times after that\nI wasn't satisfied of one of my mixdown, I had to extract the samples again lol. I used Cool Edit Pro\nto master the tracks.\n-I also extracted some of the FMV's short musics (this was not the case in my first Complete Soundtrack).\n-In some few tracks, there are unfortunately really short high-pitched sounds, I don't know from where\nthey come, lol, so I couldn't remove them (you will only hear them when listening with headphones I think).\n-This Complete Soundtrack does not contain the opening and ending musics (you can find them in the\nOfficial Soundtrack).\n-Total time spent to complete all tracks : I really don't know, but much more than 24 hours.\nIt was so long, lol.\n\nIn theory, no music is missing, so I hope it's complete lol (except the opening and endings that I left out\non purpose).
