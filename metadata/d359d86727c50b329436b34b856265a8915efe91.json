As your fame and wealth increase \n   you'll be able to add tennis courts, game houses, aviaries, \n   even the world-famous Grotto to your estate. Just make sure\n   to build enough bedrooms for your girlfriends.\n\n   Live the Playboy Lifestyle - What use is a stylish pad if you \n   can't share it with hundreds of celebrity friends? Spend the \n   afternoon poolside with a bevy of beautiful women, and then \n   change into your finest pajamas for an evening of decadent \n   dancing with chart toppers, industry moguls and all-star \n   athletes. Will you watch a movie in the Theatre Room or the \n   Playmates on the trampoline? Life can be so cruel.\n\n   Build Your Empire - Fame and fortune don't come easy. Manage \n   a crack editorial staff, hustle celebrity interviews and mold \n   the magazine in response to a fickle market. Are readers \n   suddenly interested in sports? Maybe it's time to host a tennis\n   tournament and schmooze Boris McEngroe. And remember, people \n   don't just read Playboy for the articles. Each month you'll \n   invite women to stay at the Mansion, manage their Playmate \n   training and oversee their sexy photo-shoots.\n\n\n   Features:\n\n\n   - A fully 3D environment with a dynamic, zoomable camera. Zoom \n     out and admire the majesty of each mansion area or zoom in and \n     view the excitement up close. \n\n\n   - Multiple Playboy estate areas, including the inside of the \n     Mansion, Back Lawn, Pool and Grotto, Gym, Tennis Court, Aviary\n     and Zoo, Game House and Garage. \n\n\n   - Hundreds of &amp;quot;Celebrities,&amp;quot; including actors, athletes, authors,\n     business executives, comedians, fashion designers, models, \n     musicians, politicians, racecar drivers and scientists. \n\n\n   - Empire Mode - Select your own goals (fame, circulation, \n     guests, etc) and then work over a series of months or \n     years to achieve them. \n\n\n   - Campaign Mode - A dozen campaigns that chronicle Hugh Hefner \n     and the Playboy Mansion's rise to international fame. \n\n\n   - The Playboy Philosophy - You're rewarded for living the good \n     life, having a positive sexual attitude and promoting tolerance \n     and individual freedom.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d359d86727c50b329436b34b856265a8915efe91","amp;dn":"Playboy.The.Mansion.XBOX-WAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d359d86727c50b329436b34b856265a8915efe91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,89,216,103,39,197,11,50,148,54,179,75,133,98,101,168,145,94,254,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
