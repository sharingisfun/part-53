Their music progresses from the psychedelic 60's sound of the Churchills to the hard rock of Jericho. All of these albums are very rare, and sought after by collectors for good reason.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc4d420317f7ec7721f9aca8417c4dd1b25ab87","amp;dn":"Israeli+Progressive+Rock+%281968-1972%29+-+Churchills%2C+Jericho+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc4d420317f7ec7721f9aca8417c4dd1b25ab87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,196,212,32,49,127,126,199,114,31,154,202,132,23,196,221,27,37,171,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
