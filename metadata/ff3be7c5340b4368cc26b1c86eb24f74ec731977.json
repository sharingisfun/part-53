To customize options or disable, load the frontend.exe file found in the main TA folder.)\n\nNo CD\n\n[b]Soundtrack included (Actually I forgot to include it, get it here - http://zwzsg.hosted.luckz.de/stuff/TotalA%20soundtrack )\n\nSave all 17 tracks onto your PC, then burn them onto a CD. Initiate a game, then insert the CD into the CD-Rom drive, and the game will automatically register the CD and begin playing.\n\nBtw, you can insert any audio cd during gameplay and it\\&amp;#039;ll play from within the game. =o. Just thought that was worth mentioning. It\\&amp;#039;ll automatically change tracks, either sequentially or randomly, but if you want to tamper with it, press Tab - Options - Music. Just thought that was worth mentioning.[/b]\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n[b]As this is a self functioning rip, without the need to setup, you will need to take the following actions to prepare for multiplayer play.\n\nDownload the GBLTA Register File, which will...register TA xP. Once TA is registered, you should be able to play on PhoenixWorx or the MSN Gaming Zone.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.geocities.com/intenex/GBLTARegister.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.geocities.com/intenex/GBLTARegister.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are also several other issues however, that occur to everyone with TA, which can be resolved through a few router reconfigurations and other minor changes.\n\nIf you have any problems, ask any of the pros at PhoenixWorx or the Zone, and they\\&amp;#039;ll probably help you...unless they\\&amp;#039;re in TAG or something xD.[/b]\n\nUnit / Map / Misc Crap Viewing/Creation files included\n\nMultiplayer crap included\n\nAnd a hell lot more =S. This is a GREAT game, RTS, Real Time Strategy.\n\nOh yeah, Disks One AND Two are included, thus you can do all 25 missions on both Arm and Core sides (50 total, if you were wondering), to get settled in =).\n\nI even ripped out all 50 mission Glamour shots and camp briefs (Glam shots are those leet images you see after you successfully complete a mission)\n\n(Goodie list - | 5k unit patch ~unstable~ | Various Pro TA Game Recordings | Recorded Games of Cheaters | TA Unit Information Rip | TA Conflict Crusher Setup | TA Demo Recorder Setup (Must have for multiplayer play) | TAUCP 2.3 Setup (Only use this if you removed the TAUCP Files from game | Phoenix Worx Multiplayer Gaming Client Setup | TA Glamour Shots - Camp Briefs | Elite Selected Multiplayer Pro \\&quot;Favorite\\&quot; Maps (I.E Gods of War II) | HPI Viewer | HPI Packer | 3DO Builder 2.1 / 2.02 | Lazy Scripter | Scriptor | Small AI Designer 1.1 Setup | TA Unit Background Image Rips | Various Tampered Units | Six Select \\&quot;Epic Size\\&quot; Maps, Drag to Map Folder To Use | Semi Useful Direct Link To MSN TA Gaming Zone | All Cavedog Units | And Finally, the Ultimate Solar Array Unit, Unlimited Energy, Very Useful in testing out units or getting familiarized with the game. |)\n\nRead the readme[s] for more in depth crap.\n\nHope this gives the game some credit...really was the best of its kind...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff3be7c5340b4368cc26b1c86eb24f74ec731977","amp;dn":"Total+Annihilation+3.1+Patch+No+CD+CC+%2B+BT+Maps+%2F+Units+%2B+A+Hell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff3be7c5340b4368cc26b1c86eb24f74ec731977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,59,231,197,52,11,67,104,204,38,177,200,110,178,79,116,236,115,25,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
