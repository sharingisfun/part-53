GAMESXCOPY is a powerful utility and all you need is a PC with either a CD or a DVD burner. No more threat of losing a game due to theft, scratches, skipping, freezing or other media imperfections. Your copy works just like the original; your entire collection can be archived and your investment protected. \nEither use a blank disc or write the entire game to your hard disc drive. Imagine the possibilities of playing a game without needing the original disc. \n\nHow GAMESXCOPY works: \n\nGAMESXCOPY does not change any of the original game content. GAMESXCOPY creates an exact image of your PC game. GAMESXCOPY then uses exclusive AUTO-BURN technology to transfer the image onto a CD or DVD. Once backed up, you can store your original PC game safe on the shelf and then either play your game from your hard drive or from the backup disc. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276f24abce9e4daad7dffa02305c78a8bd2a789a","amp;dn":"game+x+copy+v1+08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276f24abce9e4daad7dffa02305c78a8bd2a789a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,111,36,171,206,158,77,170,215,223,250,2,48,92,120,168,189,42,120,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
