From there you can watch them with the likes of WinDVD and PowerDVD, you can write them back to DVD-R / DVD-RW / DVD+R / DVD+RW / DVD+R DL / DVD-RAM media or you can convert them to VCD / SVCD / DivX for burning onto CD-R / CD-RW. \n\nDVD Decrypter can write most types of CD / DVD images via its 'ISO Write' mode, and it supports all the latest writers (including booktype / bitsetting on many of the major ones - i.e. BenQ, LiteOn, NEC, Plextor, Sony). You can even use DVD Decrypter to erase / format your rewritable media! \n\nAdvanced functionality can be found in context menus that appear when you right click on various bits of the user interface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9b8757b6ad4fb3a23bd050ac772207d3b06c494","amp;dn":"DVD+Decrypter+v3.5.2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9b8757b6ad4fb3a23bd050ac772207d3b06c494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,184,117,123,106,212,251,58,35,189,5,10,199,114,32,125,59,6,196,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
