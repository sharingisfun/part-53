He isn't. That doesn't stop him from embarrassing himself in front of the cameras on a regular basis, whether from his political sermonizing, his stand-up 'comedy', or his incredibly unique dancing. Meanwhile, long-suffering Tim longs after Dawn the engaged receptionist and keeps himself sane by playing childish practical jokes on his insufferable, army-obsessed deskmate Gareth. Will the Slough office be closed? Will the BBC give David a game show? Will Tim and Dawn end up with each other? And more importantly, will Gareth realize what a hopeless prat he is?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9a4240dfc3b82b733a3de11cfe88ca69f7a3a4","amp;dn":"The.Office.Complete.First.Season.R3LiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9a4240dfc3b82b733a3de11cfe88ca69f7a3a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,154,66,64,223,195,184,43,115,58,61,225,28,254,136,202,105,247,163,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
