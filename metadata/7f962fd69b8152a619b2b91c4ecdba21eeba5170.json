It is an\nunforgettable journey in the estranged mind of an unusual human being, Jacques,\nwhose obsessive fascination with the sea and strong connection with dolphins\nprevent him from leading a 'normal' life on earth. The irruption in his secluded\naquatic life of an old childhood nemesis and of a passionate woman subjects him\nto strong emotional conflicts as he feels unable to belong in the human world.\n\n\n  The story investigates the self-sacrificial nature of genuine love and the\ndestructive potential of men's rivalry. Other themes explored in the film are\nthe relationship between humans and nature, the feelings of frustration and\nalienation experienced by certain people who feel unable to fit in society, the\nmisunderstandings as well as the conflictual needs and expectations of lovers.\n\n\n  The haunting images of the majestic deep blue sea and the wonderful music are\nclose to aesthetic perfection. The viewer is allowed to sink both in the ocean\nand in the minds of the three main characters, thus sharing all their thoughts\nand emotions.\n\nCast overview:\n\nRosanna Arquette      ....
