Its got far more in common mechanically with something like the PC cult favorite TrackMania than any brand of racer, arcade or otherwise. Unfortunately, GripShifts unique qualities are undermined by one severe flaw: Driving in the game isnt much fun. Even though youre not racing, you still have to drive a vehicle around the games plentiful number of tracks or puzzles, or whatever you want to call them, and the controls for doing so are so frustratingly unwieldy that it renders the entire process an infuriating chore. Its too bad, really, as the concept of a platform heavy puzzler that features crazy cars sounds like a neat idea. GripShift just doesnt deliver on its lofty concept.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7fab3ecb00a93132d7f65ef876407f40c8e6c3","amp;dn":"PSP+-+Gripshift+%5BEUR%5D+%5BMULTI5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7fab3ecb00a93132d7f65ef876407f40c8e6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,127,171,62,203,0,169,49,50,215,246,94,248,118,64,127,64,200,230,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
