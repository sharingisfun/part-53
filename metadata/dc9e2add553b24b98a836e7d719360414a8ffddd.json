And what is that you wonder? It's the old north european folk lore that J.R.R. Tolkien based his story Lord of the Rings on.\n1853 Richard Wagner wrote an opera based on the same story, an opera that played over four nights (not continously though). That would be like seeing the P.J. LotR movie version, that is about 12 hours long, been sung divided up on four nights in a row. :)\nSilly facts, but they can be fun :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9e2add553b24b98a836e7d719360414a8ffddd","amp;dn":"Curse+of+the+Ring+-+Ring+of+the+Niebelungs+%282004%29+DVD-Cover+%5BSwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9e2add553b24b98a836e7d719360414a8ffddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,158,42,221,85,59,36,185,138,131,110,125,113,147,96,65,74,143,253,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
