Stripped Down Band Set Up, Often Live in the Studio, No Frills, Plenty of Menace, High Energy, a Rock'n'roll Sensibility Underpinning Everything. Where Jack White Has Drawn on Blues for the Bedrock to the White Stripes Material, Jesse Hector Drew on Rock 'n'roll. It is No Coincidence that Both Acts Produced Some of their Best Work at Toe Rag Studios, the First Three on this Compilation Being Recorded and Produced by Liam Watson. Other Producers have also Got Great Results from Jesse, Chiswick's Roger Armstrong Producing the Punk Era Classic Gatecrasher and the Later Jesse Hector and the Sound Recordings, Larry Page Producing the Equally Classic Version of You Really Got Me. The Latter Graces the Recent Compilation 'glitterbest' and is Often Played on the Radio by the Likes of DJ Mark Lamarr.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2555cdd4d1c22ae20d81c7aed924c1671710924","amp;dn":"Jesse+Hector+-+Gorilla+Garage%3B+The+Jesse+Hector+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2555cdd4d1c22ae20d81c7aed924c1671710924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,85,92,221,77,28,34,174,32,216,28,122,237,146,76,22,113,113,9,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
