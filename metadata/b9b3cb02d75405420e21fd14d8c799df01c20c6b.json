His name is Gyung-soo and heÃ‚Â´s an actor who is fairly well-known on stage. He trusted a director he knew well and acted in his movie, but it flopped. He persistently insisted on receiving his actors fee, but all he got was a mere grands worth. He also misses out on his chance to act in the next role he promised to do. The future looks cloudy for him.&lt;p&gt; \n\nImdb rating 7.3/137 votes\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313550&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313550 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\nEng sub included&lt;p&gt;\n\nFile: 701 MB (701 MB),  duration: 1:55:49,  type: AVI\nVideo:  591 MB,  714 Kbps,  23.976 fps,  512*288 (16:9),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4\n\nAudio:  110 MB,  133 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  2 channels,  0x55 = MPEG Layer-3&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://207.136.67.23/film/DVDReview/turninggate/turninggatebox.jpg&quot; border=0&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.coreaction.de/assets/images/Turning_Gate_-_Zug.jpg&quot; border=0&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n********************************************************** &lt;p&gt;\n\nHey!
