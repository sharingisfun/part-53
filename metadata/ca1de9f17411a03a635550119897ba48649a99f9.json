Burn off on dvd and let the kids at these.. or just for your own viewing pleasure.\n\nPic quality is very good as is the sound. Played it on standalone DVD player with surround on and worked out very well.\n\nIf you decide to watch it on the computer using mediaplayer.. remember.. the AC3 codec is aquired and even then, the speech is very silent. I suggest you use either the VLC player (free) or then Nero Showtime to get the max out of the sounds.\n\nEnjoy\n\nY69","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1de9f17411a03a635550119897ba48649a99f9","amp;dn":"Indiana+Jones+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1de9f17411a03a635550119897ba48649a99f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,29,233,241,116,17,160,58,99,85,80,17,152,151,186,72,100,154,153,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
