Many people don&amp;#039;t know this, but ESham was the first person in rap history to release a &quot;set of volumes&quot;, some think it was Master P in 1995, but it turns out the revolutionizing ESham had topped him 3 years earlier. Anyways back to the download, all the tracks are in good quality except for the 8th track has a couple cuts in it, scratched CD or something. Enjoy Juggalos n ESham fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27471ae84b60069a515ba116e205bc7403da066c","amp;dn":"Esham+-+Judgement+Day%2C+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27471ae84b60069a515ba116e205bc7403da066c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,71,26,232,75,96,6,154,81,91,161,22,226,5,188,116,3,218,6,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
