This will fit on 1 x 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin &amp;amp; cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/\n\nPlease help to seed these files, the longer myself and other posters are stuck going back to reseed the less stuff we can post!\n\nENJOY!\n\nEDIT:Live Hanley, STOKE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b694c0b3f9de2d0a9168f9603496e1e702a5d9c1","amp;dn":"GBH.Live.Hanley.Leeds.11March1983.SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b694c0b3f9de2d0a9168f9603496e1e702a5d9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,148,192,179,249,222,45,10,145,104,249,96,52,150,225,231,2,165,217,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
