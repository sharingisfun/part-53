As the Germans\nclosed in on the capital, the fighting got fiercer and more desperate. The\ndelay of the German forces after Smolensk left little time for the drive\nto Moscow before the onset of winter. And while both German and Russian High\nCommands were well aware of this, nevertheless, 'Operation Typhoon' went\nahead as planned. The attack was costly and first bogged down in endless mud,\nmaking the roads impassable. Next, the offensive was literally 'frozen in its\ntracks' when the harsh Soviet winter set in. The Germans were not provided with\nwinter clothing, and their vehicles and equipment were similarly not prepared.\nYet despite all this, they reached the western suburbs, barely 17 km from the\nKremlin, but before they ever encircled the city Soviet reinforcements arrived.\nSome of these new Russian troops were Siberian divisions, equipped and trained\nfor winter fighting.\n\nCan you capture Moscow in the face of the strengthening Red Army and the onset of\nthe bitter Russian Winter?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed02194433f94a75cbf7b8853b8e6913b26db208","amp;dn":"Panzer+Campaigns+Moscow+41","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed02194433f94a75cbf7b8853b8e6913b26db208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,2,25,68,51,249,74,117,203,247,184,133,59,142,105,19,178,109,178,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
