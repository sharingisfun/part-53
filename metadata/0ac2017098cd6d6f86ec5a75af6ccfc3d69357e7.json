The Concertgebuow always sounds great, which is the case here. The strings never get mushy as they sometimes do in recordings of Beethoven piano concertos. Everything is crisp and tight. Haitink also lets fly when necessary, generating plenty of excitement, especially in the final movement. The timing (not too slow, not too fast) and the perfect synchronization with the orchestra make this version the most beautiful and perfect available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac2017098cd6d6f86ec5a75af6ccfc3d69357e7","amp;dn":"Perahia+-+Beethoven+-+Piano+Concertos+1+%26+2+%2AMp3%40320Kbps%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac2017098cd6d6f86ec5a75af6ccfc3d69357e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,194,1,112,152,205,109,111,134,236,90,117,175,108,207,195,214,147,87,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
