We The People also have a unique quality in their songwriting, with My Brother The Man, Mirror Of You Mind, In The Past and numerous others all standing out as top quality stuff.\n\nThe band were formed out of two acts - the Trademarks and Offbeets, at the suggestion of Ron Dillman, who managed both bands. Within a week of their first meeting / rehearsal in early 1966, they were recording their first 45, My Brother, The Man, but shortly afterwards Tom Wynn was replaced by Lee Ferguson and the band signed a production and publishing deal with Nashville-based Tony Moon.\n\nWhilst their first two 45s contained punchy psychedelic rockers, He Doesn't Go About It Right contains a dollop of Kinks style humour, and St. John's Shop is a beautiful slow ballad. All were big regional hits in Florida and Tennessee, but under threat of the draft, and frustrated by the lack of national success, Wayne Proctor quit early in 1967. Shortly before his departure they recorded Love Wears Black (None), at Bradley's Barn in Nashville in early 1967, which was intended for release under the pseudonym Fresh Air. He also co-wrote The Skunks 1967 track, Don't Ask Why with Clark Taylor, which has recently been given another airing on The Quill Records Story (CD).\n\nWith Wayne pursuing a career in song-writing, the group continued, although Lee Ferguson was then drafted and replaced by Terry Cox from Those Four Guys. Now signed to RCA, national success still proved elusive, although the later 45s are still pretty good (and When I Arrive remains a complete stormer).\n\nTom Talton too left the group in 1968/69 and later resurfaced with Tom Wynn in Cowboy. We The People soldiered on for a while, but they eventually called it a day in 1970.\n\nIn addition to their 45s, the band also had two French EPs with picture sleeves: the first (London 10181) 1966 contains the four tracks that comprise the first two Challenge 45: the second (London 10184) 1967 contains St John's Shop, In The Past, Declaration Of Independence and Lovin' Son Of A Gun - the last two being non-US tracks.\n\nThe band have also been the subject of three retrospective compilations, with Sundazed's Mirror Of Our Minds being the latest and best. A double CD package, with extensive liner notes/interviews by Jeff Jarema, it includes no less than forty tracks. All their 45 cuts are featured, plus all the &quot;previously unreleased&quot; cuts that have cropped up elsewhere on other comps etc. and a whole bundle of other tracks also make their first appearance anywhere... All in all a thoroughly recommended package!\n\nCompilation appearances have included: Mirror Of Your Mind on Mayhem &amp; Psychosis, Vol. 2 (LP), Nuggets, Vol. 6 (LP), Even More Nuggets (CD), Excerpts From Nuggets (CD); In The Past on Mindrocker, Vol. 5 (LP), Psychedelic Unknowns, Vol's 1 &amp; 2 (LP), Psychedelic Unknowns, Vol. 2 (Dble 7&quot;); You Burn Me Up And Down and He Doesn't Go About It Right on Mindrocker, Vol. 6 (LP); Mirror Of Your Mind and You Burn Me Up And Down on Nuggets Box (4-CD); You Burn Me Up And Down on Psychedelic Unknowns, Vol. 4 (LP&amp; CD), Pebbles, Vol. 4 (ESD) (CD), Sound Of The Sixties (Dble LP), Sixties Archive Vol. 1 (CD), Songs We Taught The Fuzztones (Dble LP &amp; CD), The Seventh Son (LP); When I Arrive on Pebbles, Vol. 7 (LP); Girl Of My Dreams on Shutdown '66 (LP); My Brother The Man on Filling The Gap (4-LP), Garage Punk Unknowns, Vol. 4 (4-LP) and Psychedelic States: Florida Vol. 3 (CD).\n\nThe CD compilation Psychedelic Microdots Of The Sixties, Vol. 1 too is also of interest as not only does it include original masters of My Brother The Man, Mirror Of Your Mind, You Burn Me Up And Down and In The Past to whet your appetite but also four unreleased tracks, By The Rule, Half Of Wednesday, Free Information and Too Much Noise. The same tracks, plus The Color Of Love, St. John's Shop, Alfred, What Kind Of Man Are You? and Beginning Of The End also appear on I Turned Into A Helium Balloon (CD).\n\n\nWe The People / Mirror Of Our Minds\nTrack Title\nDisc 1\t\n1.Everything'll Be Alright\t \n2.Drivin' Me Out Of My Mind\t \n3.My Brother, The Man [Version 1]\t \n4.Mirror Of Your Mind\t \n5.(You Are) The Color Of Love\t \n6.She Does Everything For Me\t \n7.He Doesn't Go About It Right\t \n8.You Burn Me Up And Down\t \n9.Nothing Like A Vision [Demo]\t \n10.Proceed With Caution\t \n11.By The Rule\t \n12.Look At The Girls [Version 1]\t \n13.Love Is A Beautiful Thing\t \n14.Double Trouble\t \n15.Don't Say You Love Me Too\t \n16.St. John's Shop [Version 1]\t \n17.Love Wears Black (None) [Version 1]\t \n18.Beginning Of The End\t \n19.The Day She Dies\t \n20.There's Gonna Be A Storm\n\nDisc 2\n1.When I Arrive\n2.No, No Boys\n3.In the Past\n4.Alfred, What Kind of Man Are You\n5.Boy, She Just Don't Feel It\n6.Declaration of Independence\n7.Look at the Girls (version 2)\n8.Follow Me Back to Louisville\n9.Lovin' Sun of a Gun\n10.St. John's Shop (version 2)\n11.Half of Wednesday\n12.Fluorescent Hearts\n13.I Wanna Do It\n14.She Lied\n15.Ain't Gonna Find Nobody (Better Than You)\n16.My Brother, The Man (version 2)\n17.Free Information\n18.You Like Me, You Love Me\n19.Too Much Noise\n20.Love Wears Black (None) (version 2)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c87cc90f4580c6c274a4c85415e185ccf8f5ae8","amp;dn":"We+The+People+-+Mirror+Of+Our+Minds+2+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c87cc90f4580c6c274a4c85415e185ccf8f5ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,135,204,144,244,88,12,108,39,74,76,133,65,94,24,92,207,143,90,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
