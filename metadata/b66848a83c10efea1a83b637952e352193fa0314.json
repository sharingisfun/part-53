The novel grows from two separate subplots. In the first, three imprisoned ex-judges (the &quot;brethren&quot; in the title), frustrated by their loss of power and influence, concoct an elaborate blackmail scheme that preys on wealthy, closeted gay men. The second story traces the rise of presidential candidate Aaron Lake, a puppet essentially created by CIA director Teddy Maynard to fulfill Maynard's plans for restoring the power of his beleaguered agency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b66848a83c10efea1a83b637952e352193fa0314","amp;dn":"The+Brethren+-+Piratebay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b66848a83c10efea1a83b637952e352193fa0314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,104,72,168,60,16,239,234,26,131,182,55,149,46,53,33,147,250,3,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
