They have stumbled upon a paper written some 50 years before that claims to know when the world will end.\n\nFeaturing excellent acting and very well put together screenplay, End of the harvest will provoke thought in both christians and non-christians alike on how long this world is going to continue and when it will end. Very well done.\n\nFive Star Review at Amazon.com\n\nCTCA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfec2047f037484c5ccef26e825f5012a098139a","amp;dn":"End+of+the+Harvest+%281998%29+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfec2047f037484c5ccef26e825f5012a098139a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,236,32,71,240,55,72,76,92,206,242,110,130,95,80,18,160,152,19,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
