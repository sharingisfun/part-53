Use OfficePoltergeist to:\n\n    * Play spooky sounds\n    * Open or close cd drives\n    * Transmit text through your victim's keyboard\n    * Make windows shake\n    * Turn monitors on and off\n    * Move windows slightly left and right\n    * Send popup alert messages\n\nOFFICEPOLTERGEIST IS NOT SPYWARE.\n\nWhile OfficePoltergeist does allow you to take limited control of another person's computer, it does not allow remote users to read data or execute potentially harmful commands.\n\nThe goal is to be obnoxious, but not destructive.\n\nOfficePoltergeist does not install itself or remain in memory after the game is over. While the OfficePoltergeist server does run as stealthily as it can to avoid the victim's attention, OfficePoltergeist is totally gone when the user restarts his or her machine. \n\nSource code is available for OfficePoltergeist.\n\nMore details at OfficePoltergeist.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1241b9ef0130dadae007255af3562d76d20523b7","amp;dn":"OfficePoltergeist+1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1241b9ef0130dadae007255af3562d76d20523b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,65,185,239,1,48,218,218,224,7,37,90,243,86,45,118,210,5,35,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
