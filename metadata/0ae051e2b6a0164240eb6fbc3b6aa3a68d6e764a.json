With better controls than SSX3 and Amped 2, this game has a vast arsenal of tricks. Off-piste? If there's a downhill, you can ride it.\n\nStunning graphics, easy-to-learn, precise controls and variety in music makes this game one of the most entertaining extreme sports-game on the market.\n\nJust try it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae051e2b6a0164240eb6fbc3b6aa3a68d6e764a","amp;dn":"TransWorld+Snowboarding+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae051e2b6a0164240eb6fbc3b6aa3a68d6e764a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,224,81,226,182,160,22,66,64,235,111,188,59,106,163,166,141,110,118,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
