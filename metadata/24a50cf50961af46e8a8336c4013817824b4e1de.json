Although it is a Mobil Masterpiece Theater presentation, it is also available on video. If you think you&amp;#039;re in for some boring English drama, brace yourself, as it is very fast-paced, erotic, and often shockingly funny. Alex Kingston (now on &quot;ER&quot;) delves into this role with a ferocity we rarely see on the screen. Although Moll does many bad things, we root for her the whole way. Diana Rigg is also a hoot as a mother-in-law that reveals herself to be something more. Daniel Defoe&amp;#039;s condemnation of society as unforgiving of the monsters it creates is still as relevant today as when it was written. As long as you have an open mind about sex, nudity and immoral behavior onscreen, prepare to be fascinated.\n\n--\n\nSEED PLEASE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24a50cf50961af46e8a8336c4013817824b4e1de","amp;dn":"Moll+Flanders+-+dvdrip+Xvid+MP3+2cd+%2Bmedia%5Blilwoodenboy%5D+TPB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24a50cf50961af46e8a8336c4013817824b4e1de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,165,12,245,9,97,175,70,232,168,51,108,64,19,129,120,36,180,225,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
