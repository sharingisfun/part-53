I filmed this back in 1995 and theres also one track from Glasgow 1994 which is all i filmed before Rancid played due to a low battery. I have a couple of other shows by them and you if you like this one then i will post those too!\n\nIts filmed in my usual high standard and is a great show by them, enjoy!\n\nI also put a live song by another brilliant Scottish band called Shatterhand just to fill the space up, hope you like them!\n\nBroccoli - Cas'Rock Edinburgh 3rd March 1995 SVCD 35 minutes\nBroccoli - Nice And Sleazy Glasgow 22nd October 1994 SVCD 3 minutes\nShatterhand - Planting Seeds Leven Fife March 2002 SVCD 3 minutes\n\nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin &amp; cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/\n\nEnjoy bandit999\n\nwww.punktorrents.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a1315b3c0ceb6e8659755a45f647e5fa5ee305","amp;dn":"Broccoli+-+CasRock+Edinburgh+3rd+March+1995%5Bbandit999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a1315b3c0ceb6e8659755a45f647e5fa5ee305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,161,49,91,60,12,235,110,134,89,117,90,69,246,71,229,250,94,227,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
