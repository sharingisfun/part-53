This was recorded in 1994.  It&amp;#039;s difficult to describe their sound, and I&amp;#039;ve never been good at describing music, anyway.  Back in 1994 they were a very loud band, and it&amp;#039;s evident on this one.  There&amp;#039;s a lot of punk influence in there, but sometimes they have a trombone in there and all kinds of shit.  \n\ninformation and track list -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_Down_in_Turpentine\n\nband&amp;#039;s website -- http://www.baboonland.com/\n\n224 Kbps\n\nLet me know what you think.
