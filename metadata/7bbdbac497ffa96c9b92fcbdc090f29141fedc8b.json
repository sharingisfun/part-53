That was the latest animal song that I wrote. This is the first animal song I ever wrote. (before Maggie's Farm)\n\nThis is a new song we just recorded about a month ago. Should be out in about a year or so. Called Dead Man, Dead Man When Will You Arise\n\nThank you. All right, that was Clydie King. We're gonna try a song off this new album of ours. Forthcoming, so called new album. [lots of requests from the audience] Uh? OK, we'll try and do that later. Anyway, this is the main title song called Shot Of Love. We ain't done this before outside of the aeroplane but we?re gonna try it\n\nThank you. I wanna do a Dave Mason song, just because I like Dave Mason songs. I don't wanna leave you without doing one Dave Mason song. Which one are we gonna do? (before We Just Disagree)\n\nAll right, we?re gonna try .., this is a new (....) I?m told they?re playing it on the radio anyway. [Bob tries out the organ] I?m gonna try and do the best I can. (plays Heart Of Mine) All right. I won?t do that again, last time. Anyway this one here?s a little easier, it?s called Watered-Down Love. You don't want a love that's pure, you wanna drown love, you want a watered-down love. One, two, three, four\n\nThank you. Thank you very much for coming here. I wanna introduce to the fellow playing keyboards all night long. On the keyboards, William T Smith from, Portsmouth, Virginia. It?s the first time I?ve ever (....) for him. Well, over left next to him, You met this girl already, Carolyn Dennis. All these girls can sing, you know that. Standing next to her is Madelyn Quebec. On the guitars tonight, Fred Tackett. And don't jump all over yourself now. On the lead guitar, Steve Ripley. Young lady on the left is Regina McCreary. Standing next to her is Clydie King. We try to play a whole lot of stuff when we're here just now, but I know we left some things out. If we come back, we'll do those. I wish we were going to be here tomorrow, we could do all the stuff we started doing ..., left out. Anyway, ... oh well, thank you. Ha-ha! On the bass guitar tonight, he-he, you're gonna have to go out a long way to hurt me! On bass guitar is Tim Drummond. And on the drums, you know who's on the drums by now, no really, I think this band?s one of the best ever, what do you think? [loud cheers] I get tired of reading things I don't like. I sometimes like to ask you what you think. Anyway, on the drums from Tulsa, Oklahoma, by way of San Antonio, Texas, Mr. Jim Keltner. I wanna thank you once again. Goodnight.
