Johnny Cash sang with Elvis in the 1950s, Dylan in the 1960s, and Bono in the 1990s, then was discovered by yet another generation of fans through his work with Def Jam founder and producer Rick Rubin in the last decade of his life. He was a complex country singer bold enough to oppose the Vietnam War and caring enough to play concerts for soldiers in the field. Rare early footage of him on stage imitating Elvis reveals a seldom seen humorous side, and touching interviews with family members and fellow musicians like Roseanne Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, and Elvis Costello complete the portrait.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113429421fda965731a1ccba77349531d010b0e9","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+The+Last+Great+American+%28BBC+TV+broadcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113429421fda965731a1ccba77349531d010b0e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,52,41,66,31,218,150,87,49,161,204,186,119,52,149,49,208,16,176,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
