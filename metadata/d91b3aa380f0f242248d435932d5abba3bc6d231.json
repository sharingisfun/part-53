Parts of it are \nfantastic.  The crowd is very vocal on this one yelling out for songs such as (this one \namazes me since this song had just been written less than a year before and was never \nreleased until years later) \\\\\\&quot;Blind Willie McTell,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Solid Rock,\\\\\\&quot; and even the Rolling \nStones / Mick Taylor classic \\\\\\&quot;Time Waits For No One\\\\\\&quot; (at the end of track 3, disc 2).  \nAlso someone yells out at the end of the first acoustic set \\\\\\&quot;Where is the Band,\\\\\\&quot; which is \nquite a tribute to them as Dylan was putting on a great solo performance at the time.  \nTaylor plays a fantastic solo on Greg Suttons \\\\\\&quot;Imagination.\\\\\\&quot;  The setlist is fairly typical.  \n\\\\\\&quot;Man of Peace\\\\\\&quot; is included this night (replaces \\\\\\&quot;Simple Twist of Fate\\\\\\&quot;) and is really one \nof the better versions of it.  \\\\\\&quot;Why Do I Have To Choose\\\\\\&quot; is interesting because Taylor \nopts NOT to play slide on it (he plays the second solo on it this night).  Santana as usual \nruins every song he plays on with his bad tone and solos that do not fit in with the music.  \nOne interesting thing that happened was that \\\\\\&quot;All Along the Watchtower\\\\\\&quot; was played \ntwice this night.  Once in it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s usual spot in the show and then as the last song.  Also, \nSantana\\\\\\&amp;#039;s conga players are on the last couple of songs.  Right now is the 20th nniversary \nof those shows and I thought it would be cool to release each show to STG on the date of \nthe actual show plus 20 years.  So, here is the eleventh show; only 16 more!!!  We\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll see \nif I can keep up with the rest of the tour.
