Which side are you on?\n\nCombining real time strategy and first person action, Savage delivers the next level in multiplayer gaming. Instead of sending mindless computer drones into battle, imagine organizing real human players on a crusade to conquer your adversary. Choose to be a commander, and you will play an in-depth RTS game, researching technologies, mining resources, and issuing orders to your units. Choose to be a warrior, and you will play an intense game of first person combat, wielding your weapon of choice to strike down the enemy.\n\nSavage is designed so that neither RTS nor Action based play are watered down in any way. RTS fans will have all the control they are used to, such as: tech tree, resource management, and tactical strategy. In turn, the action-based players will play an in-depth fighting game with a heavy emphasis on battle dynamics. Although the two sides work together their roles are very distinct.\n\ntranslation:     :)\nsavage is a game that is kind of a mix between counter-strike and some crazy fantasy game...you run around with guns and shoot people! you also build stuff. it is an online multiplayer game so you can play with people around the world.\n\n\n______________installation____________________\n    -un-rar the file &lt;use win-rar or win-ace&gt;\n    -un-zip the ziped file wherever\n    -install the game\n    -use one of the provided cd-keys found in the text file\n    -apply the provided patch\n \nafter you do all this you will be able to play online.  this has been tested and it works 100%\n\n_____________ viruses/spyware________________\nthis game has absolutely NO spware or viruses i can promise you that...it is so gay when people do that shit.  this is the strait up game.\n\n\n\nplease help me seed\nplease dont spam\n\n&lt;================//compiled\\=======================================================&gt;\n&lt;----------------------//by\\-------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;=======================//surfingturtle\\==========================================\n\n\n\np.s. leave me comments and let me know how it works for you and what you think of it. if you are having problems, leave me a comment and i will help you out as best as i can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd37d43bde4bab9894d5d090fa4f0491583e3d3","amp;dn":"Savage%3A+The+Battle+for+Newerth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd37d43bde4bab9894d5d090fa4f0491583e3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,211,125,67,189,228,186,185,137,77,93,9,15,164,240,73,21,131,227,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
