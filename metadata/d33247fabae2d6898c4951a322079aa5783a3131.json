It's pretty much this lecture in a nutshell: http://www.prisonplanet.tv/articles/september2004/200904newmap.htm***\n\nIn a PowerPoint presentation Professor Barnett talked about developing a global perspective that integrates political, economic and military elements in a model for the post-September 11 world. He argued that terrorism and globalization had combined to end the great-power model of war that has developed over 400 years, since the Thirty Years War. \n\nInstead, he divided the world into an increasingly expanding &quot;functioning core&quot; of economically developed, politically stable states integrated into global systems and a &quot;non-integrating gap,&quot; the most likely source of threats to U.S. and international security. Professor Barnett used this map to call for a new system for deployment of the U.S. armed forces. Following his remarks he answered questions from military officials in the audience.\n\nName.........: CSPAN-Thomas.Barnett-Pentagon's.New.Map.XviD.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 715,873 KB or 733,054,094 bytes)\nRuntime......: 02:42:20 (291,895 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD (DX50)\nVideo Bitrate: 546 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-2 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 48 kb/s, monophonic CBR \nFrame Size...: 384x288 (1.33:1) [=4:3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d33247fabae2d6898c4951a322079aa5783a3131","amp;dn":"The+Pentagons+New+Map+%28Fascism%2FCorporatism+for+dummies%29+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d33247fabae2d6898c4951a322079aa5783a3131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,50,71,250,186,226,214,137,140,73,81,163,34,7,154,165,120,58,49,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
