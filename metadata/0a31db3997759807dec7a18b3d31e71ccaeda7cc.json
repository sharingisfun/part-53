First published as a novel in 1883, it was \noriginally serialised in the children&amp;#039;s magazine Young Folks \nbetween 1881-82 under the title The Sea Cook, or Treasure \nIsland.\n\nTraditionally considered a coming of age story, it is an \nadventure tale of superb atmosphere, character and action, \nand also a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality?as \nseen in Long John Silver?unusual for children&amp;#039;s literature \nthen and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatised of \nall novels, and its influence on popular lore about pirates \ncan not be overestimated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a31db3997759807dec7a18b3d31e71ccaeda7cc","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+Treasure+Island+-+Robert+Louis+Stevenson+%5BLibrivox%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a31db3997759807dec7a18b3d31e71ccaeda7cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,49,219,57,151,117,152,7,222,199,161,139,61,49,231,28,202,237,167,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
