Some very heavy\nguitar-riffs mixed with more mellow parts with lots of piano, flute,\nacoustic guitar and even banjo. They made four albums up until 1977,\nand this is the one to start with. This is not a progressive line release.\nThis is either an official Polydor-release or a very well done Bootleg-CD.\n\nPossibly this has been seeded before, but I'm new here so I don't know.\nThis is my first torrent, so I hope it works out fine...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ddf33848c4266aa7ed55ce1bb3ef42d462f8294","amp;dn":"Culpeper%5C%27s+Orchard+-+Same+1971+%28Excellent+heavy+Danish+progress","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ddf33848c4266aa7ed55ce1bb3ef42d462f8294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,223,51,132,140,66,102,170,126,213,92,225,187,62,244,45,70,47,130,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
