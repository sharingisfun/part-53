Now it's three. O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green were         \nthe first to fall, now The Bride (Uma Thurman) is out to finish the job by killing      \nElle Driver, Budd, and last of all, Bill (David Carradine). If the final three aren't   \nafraid now, they better start, because she's coming for them. However,                  \nsomething has thrown off her plans a bit. Her daughter (whom she was pregnant           \nwith as she was getting married) is still alive. What affect this will have on          \nher quest for vengeance is unclear, but the question is, will The Bride have          \nactually succeeded in completing her ultimate goal, to kill Bill\n\n\n
