Sound quality is pretty good for an outdoor festival audience recording.  This will appeal mostly to hard core Roky fans as his vocals were a bit rough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07360d14b417803063bb52b5d4ee1fc51b57ab0a","amp;dn":"Roky+Erickson+2005-09-24+ACL+Festival%2C+Austin+TX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07360d14b417803063bb52b5d4ee1fc51b57ab0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,54,13,20,180,23,128,48,99,187,82,181,212,238,31,197,27,87,171,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
