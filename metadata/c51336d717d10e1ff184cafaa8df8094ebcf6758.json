The \njoy of reading Wodehouse is in his other-worldliness. George \nOrwell stated in his defence of PG Wodehouse that although \nthe majority of his 'Jeeves' stories were set in the aftermath \nof the Great War, his characters stayed rooted in the \nEdwardian age.\n\nFor more free audiobooks: http://librivox.org/ \nLibrivox audibooks are read by volunteer readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51336d717d10e1ff184cafaa8df8094ebcf6758","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+Psmith+in+the+City+-+P.G.Wodehouse+%5BLibrivox%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51336d717d10e1ff184cafaa8df8094ebcf6758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,19,54,215,23,209,14,31,241,132,202,250,168,223,128,148,235,207,103,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
