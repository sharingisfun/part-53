If installing in vmware, do not mount the ISO with vmware, mount it with daemon tools or alcohol120% and set vmware to use that\n\n2. currently, you need PAE and SSE2 to boot this in vmware, however it will not boot native without NX\n\nAfter it is installed, you can look on the cd in dir &quot;Maxxuss Extras&quot; and you will find a few drivers from Maxxuss's site, this should make it easier to get a fully functional system without having to switch back and forth between Mac and Windows\n\n\nHere are the notes from Maxxuss:\n\nBooting and Installing\n\nThe patched ISO image contains three different Mach Kernels. You need to boot the patched DVD/ISO with the right kernel for your CPU needs:\n\n    * mach_kernel (default): same as mach_kernel.sse2,\n    * mach_kernel.sse2: supports SSE2 CPUs, requires NX/XD CPU support,\n    * mach_kernel.nonx: supports SSE2 CPUs, does not require NX/XD CPU support,\n    * mach_kernel.orig: the original kernel, for use with SSE3 CPUs with NX/XD support.\n\nIf you're fine with the default kernel, there is nothing to do. (If you get the error &quot;Cannot load /com.apple.Boot.plist&quot; after the boot prompt, enter the boot promt and hit Return; this might help.)\n\nBut if you require for example &quot;mach_kernel.nonx&quot;, then you should press F8 at the Mac Boot Prompt and enter &quot;mach_kernel.nonx&quot;.\nBooting from the Installed Mac OS X Volume\n\nAfter the installation has succeeded, you can now boot your new system. As before, there are several kernels available for your CPU needs (see the list above: mach_kernel, mach_kernel.sse2, mach_kernel.nonx and mach_kernel.orig.\n\nTo select your kernel of choice, you have several options:\n\n    * Enter the name at the boot promt, e.g. &quot;mach_kernel.nonx&quot;,\n    * As root or with &quot;sudo&quot; copy the kernel file to &quot;mach_kernel&quot;, e.g. &quot;cp /mach_kernel.nonx /mach_kernel&quot;,\n    * As root or with &quot;sudo&quot; edit the file &quot;com.apple.Boot.plist&quot; in the folder &quot;/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration&quot;.\n\nNotes\nVMWare\n\nIf you boot Mac OS X 10.4.3 in VMWare please note:\n\n    * Set &quot;paevm=true&quot; in your .vmx configuration file\n\n    * Mount the ISO using Daemon Tools etc., not with the VMWare CD/DVD drive emulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: THIS HAS BEEN TESTED!\n\nIf you need assistance, you can always visit www.osx86project.org or http://win2osx.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page OR on irc at irc.osx86project.org #osx86","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97fd591786580d67afe20a028da687ef1d79ee7c","amp;dn":"Mac+OSx86+Build+8f1099+with+Universal+iTunes+and+Patched+with+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97fd591786580d67afe20a028da687ef1d79ee7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,253,89,23,134,88,13,103,175,226,10,2,141,166,135,239,29,121,238,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
