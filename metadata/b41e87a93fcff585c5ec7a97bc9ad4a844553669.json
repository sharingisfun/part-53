The drama is intercut throughout with scenes depicting the FÃƒÂ¼hrerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final days in 1945.\nAs his plans to turn Germany into a Ã¢â‚¬ËœpureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nation develop, Hitler forms a warm yet dysfunctional relationship with Geli, 19 years his junior, lavishing her with gifts and attention. But the dictatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempt to control and manipulate those closest to him, as well as his country, leads to tragedy.\nFilmed on location in Lithuania, Uncle Adolf recreates 1930s Munich, including HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luxurious flat and the Brown House Nazi HQ and the 1945 Berlin bunker where he and his devoted followers, including Eva, meet their deaths.\n\nFile : 697 Mb, duration 1:31:45\nVideo : 935 Kbps, 25.0 fps, res. 528*336 (16:9),  XVID\nAudio : 127 Kbps, 48000 Hz, 2 chan., MP3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b41e87a93fcff585c5ec7a97bc9ad4a844553669","amp;dn":"Uncle+Adolf+%282004%29+analogueTVrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b41e87a93fcff585c5ec7a97bc9ad4a844553669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,30,135,169,63,207,245,133,197,236,122,151,188,154,212,168,68,85,54,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
