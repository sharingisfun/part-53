The first single\nfrom the album, &quot;Mind On the Road,&quot; will be featured in EA Sports&amp;AElig;\npopular football title, &quot;Madden 2006.&quot;\n\nRun, born Joseph Simmons, is the younger brother of Hip-Hop mogul\nRussell Simmons.\n\nRussell Simmons recently launched a new label, the Russell Simmons\nMusic Group, which is distributed by the Island Def Jam Music Group,\na Universal company.\n\nSimmons managed Run-DMC before founding pioneering Hip-Hop label, Def\nJam Records along with partner Rick Rubin in 1984.\n\n&quot;Timing is everything,&quot; Russell Simmons said in a statement. &quot;The\nuncompromising loud abrasive rock and roll hip-hop of Run-DMC knocked\nopen the doors to commercial freedom for the rap generation. Their\nvery best efforts were big in the streets and were ahead of their\ntime when it came to the mainstream. The debut album from Rev Run,\nDistortion, is honest, creative, special, refreshing, and still\nincredibly commercial. The time is now for Rev Run.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9e7529ca525d01d4f1a560b8b3e44cc84e1f5e7","amp;dn":"Rev_Run-Distortion-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9e7529ca525d01d4f1a560b8b3e44cc84e1f5e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,231,82,156,165,37,208,29,79,26,86,11,139,62,68,204,132,225,245,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
