If you have any questions about this program, you can ask me :=) I would seed so much I can, but I donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t have so fast upload, only 20KB/s.\nSo I would love to have any other seeders. \nI think this is exactly as EJay Techno 2, because it have the same functions as Ejay Techno 2, but the difference is that \nEJay Techno ONLY runs at Win9x, ME and NT 4.0.\n\nSo it doesn't work on Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7\n\nThe languages are Swedish, Danish, Finnish and Norwegian. \nIt is English in the program, but you must choose a language to have a subtitle, with other words, you canÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t choose English, itÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s in the program.\n\nSo this is what you gonna do:\n1st: Burn or mount the files with CloneCd or Deamon Tools.\n2st: Install EJay Techno.\n3st: Enyoy the program.\n\nSorry for my English, but IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´m only a 13 years old guy from Sweden.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febcb8ccdf50a2102df950432f865e7abeff2c64","amp;dn":"EJay+Techno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febcb8ccdf50a2102df950432f865e7abeff2c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,188,184,204,223,80,162,16,45,249,80,67,47,134,94,122,190,255,44,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
