Now Trevor's a time bomb himself--troubled, misunderstood, and on the brink of committing real violence. Salvation comes in the form of a caring drama teacher named Mr. Duncan (Tom Cavanagh), who offers Trevor the lead in the school play. But when the community gets wind of the play's subject matter--school violence and playground killers--as well as its troubled protagonist, the production is in jeopardy, as is Trevor's attempt to avoid calamity. This gritty, hard-hitting drama offers an authentic glimpse inside the post-Columbine high schools of America and the forces that can compel a teen to violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e36e7aa2f4e7a32c4f7db85c5ec162b9e706e3e","amp;dn":"Bang+Bang+You+Are+Dead+2002+DVDRip+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e36e7aa2f4e7a32c4f7db85c5ec162b9e706e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,54,231,170,47,78,122,50,196,247,219,133,197,236,22,43,158,112,110,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
