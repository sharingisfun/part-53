The film is an early treatment of feminism, because the wives of the miners play a pivotal role in the strike, against their husbands wishes. In the end, the greatest victory for the workers and their families is the realization that prejudice and poor treatment are conditions that are not always imposed by outside forces. This film was written, directed and produced by members of the original &amp;amp;quot;Hollywood Ten,&amp;amp;quot; who were blacklisted for refusing to answer Congressional inquiries on First Amendment grounds.&amp;quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee7a8bbd8cde9328b8ef7ba933aabe80ae99edd","amp;dn":"Salt+of+the+Earth+1954+%28DVDrip+DiVx%29+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee7a8bbd8cde9328b8ef7ba933aabe80ae99edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,231,168,187,216,205,233,50,139,142,247,186,147,58,171,232,10,233,158,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
