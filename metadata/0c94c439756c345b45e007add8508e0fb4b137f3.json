From director Edmond Pang and producer Vincent Kok comes the 2001 comedy You Shoot, I Shoot, a winning send-up of Hong Kong&amp;#039;s economic problems, its lumbering film industry, and the assassination game itself! The story centers on Bart (Eric Kot), an assassin whose business is suffering through some hard times thanks to the Asian economic crisis. His latest client has an interesting proposition for him: Mrs. Ma (Miao Felin) wants to hire Bart to take out a number of people, all because they videotaped her having sex and then released the footage on VCD! To even the score with these amateur pornographers, she wants Bart to film the hit, so he hires a struggling assistant director named Chuen (Chueng Tat Ming) to helm this unique cinematic endeavor!\n\nChuen, however, fancies himself a real filmmaker and initially balks at the arrangement, but eventually gives in to Bart&amp;#039;s request. Chuen, of course, becomes even more resistant to the partnership once the real purpose of Bart&amp;#039;s mission is revealed, but despite his objections, he soon finds himself adapting to the situation. Chuen edits the footage into a short film, and before long, this strange two-man hitman/director team become all the rage in the assassination business, earning them even more clients, spawning a couple imitators (Lam Suet and Tats Lau), and forcing an inevitable face-off with local authorities. There&amp;#039;s even time for a little romance as sparks start to fly between Chuen and a Japanese erotic film star played by Asuke Higuchi! What will become of Bart and Chuen? Their final fate can be discovered in the brilliantly funny satire You Shoot, I Shoot! \n\n-------------------------------------\nRegion Code: Region Free\nPicture Format\t: NTSC\n* Language: AC3-2 ch.Cantonese(Original Language), Mandarin\nSubtitle :\tEnglish ,Simplified Chinese ,  Traditional Chinese\n* Screen Format: LetterBoxed\n* DVD Type: DVD-5 x 2 {used DVDFAB to split original DVD9 to 2 dvd-5 discs.}\n\n* Extras:\n  Features Film\n  ?Audio Commentary 1: by director Pang Ho-cheung &amp; producer Vincent Kok\n?
