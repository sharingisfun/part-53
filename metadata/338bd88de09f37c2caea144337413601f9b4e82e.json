You are hired as a television-programming director by a crusty, cigar-smoking boss who gives you the job of beating two competing stations out of various Emmy awards. To do this, you have to win over the audience by playing the programs that they want to watch while making money for the station by airing commercials. Sound easy? Think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a snap? WRONG.\n\nThe commercials require a certain percentage of viewers in order for the station to get their money, which means you have to buy interesting programs from the limited resources available, which costs money you have to make from the commercial ads, which meansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ARGH!!!! In addition, you are vying for the attention of Betty, a cute little snob of a television exec who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give you the time of day unless you cater to her whims. Plus, this game is timed so you have to be quick on your feet or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be out on your bum.\n\nThis German game has cult status in Europe and is considered to be among the best of the best. Sadly, there is little help in cyberspace as to how to actually PLAY this game. The only method I have found to understand this game is by trial and error. Still, the AI is pretty smart and the bizarre factor is high. Since this game is relatively small, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth a download\n\nOld Game 1991  but fun :)\n\nif anybody have MadTV 2 in english please seed it can't find it anywhere :/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338bd88de09f37c2caea144337413601f9b4e82e","amp;dn":"MadTV+rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338bd88de09f37c2caea144337413601f9b4e82e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,139,216,141,224,159,55,194,202,234,20,67,55,65,54,1,249,180,232,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
