Their music often draws comparison to The Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen and U2, as well as new bands such as The Killers and Franz Ferdinand. They have been named one of Rolling Stone magazine\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;10 Artists to Watch in 2006\\&quot;.\n\nRock Kills Kid?s self-titled 5-song EP was released in early 2001 by Fearless Records. The incarnation of the band included Tucker with a revolving door of session musicians, and never toured. With no money and no place to live, Tucker began sleeping at the recording studio Fearless was paying for in Los Angeles.\n\nTucker later regrouped with a new line-up of Rock Kills Kid, which includes Dailey, Stopnik, Calhoun, and Hendrickson. They signed to Reprise Records and are currently touring in support of their debut album, \\&quot;Are You Nervous\\&quot;. A tour in fall 2005/early 2006 with Electric Six and She Wants Revenge further boosted their profile, as did the use of \\&quot;Hide Away\\&quot; on an episode of FOX drama The O.C.\n\n\\&quot;Hide Away\\&quot; was an iTunes free download in April 2006. \\&quot;Paralyzed\\&quot; is the first single off \\&quot;Are You Nervous\\&quot; and was sent to radio that same month.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1681902f6e92e92b4192dba76895304be4a488e","amp;dn":"Rock+Kills+Kid+-+Are+You+Nervous+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1681902f6e92e92b4192dba76895304be4a488e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,104,25,2,246,233,46,146,180,25,45,186,118,137,83,4,190,74,72,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
