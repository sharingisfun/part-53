We kept all extras to give u something more.\n There is a teaser of Ice Age 2 and some more things :)\n \n Reason why we dont tag it PROPER is because we dont kept the\n finnish audio, and because the NoGrp release works on some\n dvd-systems.\n But still, end credits missing!\n \n \n Over and out...\n \n //Zilvershine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf938ec61ab6f7daa83018a069e4e804f9d78f5","amp;dn":"Robots.PAL.SE.FI.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf938ec61ab6f7daa83018a069e4e804f9d78f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,249,56,236,97,171,111,125,170,131,1,138,6,158,78,128,79,157,120,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
