They had four Top Ten hits in Sweden during 1966 and 1967 although were largely unknown outside the country. This is a timely reminder of their brand of merseybeat, pop rock and fuzzy garage. ? freakemporium.com\n\n[img]http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/8743/coversmallcr0.jpg[/img]\n\nOne of the many competent Swedish bands imitating Anglo rock in the mid-&amp;#039;60s, the Fabulous Four had four Top Ten hits in their native country in 1966 and 1967, failing to make a ripple elsewhere. In the manner of many Swedish acts, they had an almost willful lack of identity. They tried sub-Merseybeat, folk-rock, and fuzzy garage, sometimes echoing groups like the Kinks and the Monkees. They wrote much of their material, but had their hits with awful covers of foreign pop tunes such as &quot;Puff (The Magic Dragon)&quot; and &quot;Rhythm of the Rain&quot; -- recorded, one suspects, against their will. Their stuff is not worth tracking down unless you&amp;#039;ve got a serious jones for &amp;#039;60s Continental rock, though judged by the standards of that category, they produced some acceptable recordings. ? allmusicguide\n\n[img]http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/3753/backsmallyv7.jpg[/img]\n\nTracker: ht*p://tpb.tracker.prq.to/announce\nSize: 126 MB\nBitrate: 320 kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Puff The Magic Dragon \n02 - Rhytm Of The Rain \n03 - Island In The Sun \n04 - Don&amp;#039;t Go Out Into The Rain \n05 - After All \n06 - Sheila \n07 - You Were On My Mind \n08 - Love Minus Zero \n09 - I Still Love You \n10 - Rotten Rats \n11 - Boom Boom \n12 - This Land Is Your Land \n13 - Anita, Change Your Mind \n14 - Extacy \n15 - Ginny Come Lately \n16 - Beer Party \n17 - Uffes Drimm \n18 - Ain&amp;#039;t That Just Like Me - Rockin&amp;#039; Robin \n\nEnjoy &amp; please seed back!\n\nVisit my blog http://knuthulu.blogspot.com/ and download more music like this directly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:625361953b2fc6781071b6cfcc48b1a6ac93a652","amp;dn":"Fabulous+Four+%3F+Fabulous+%28Swedish+Beat+1965-68++%3F+320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"625361953b2fc6781071b6cfcc48b1a6ac93a652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,83,97,149,59,47,198,120,16,113,182,207,204,72,177,166,172,147,166,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
