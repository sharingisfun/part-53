An album of all-new material, titled\nBefore The Robots, is slated for a April 12, 2005 release. Formed in 1988 in New\nOrleans, Better Than Ezra began their career by playing college bars and\nfraternity houses at Louisiana State University. After independently releasing a\ncassette-only album in 1990 (Suprise) to great acclaim, the band went on to make\ntheir major label debut in 1995, Deluxe. Fueled by the #1 modern rock smash\n&amp;quot;Good&amp;quot;, Deluxe earned platinum status. In 1996 the band's follow-up record\nFriction Baby went gold and contained two Top Ten modern rock tracks. Better\nThan Ezra have released two subsequent albums - 1998's How Does Your Garden\nGrow? and 2001's Closer.\n\n\nMysbra! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91be2db3d999d30eb01c0a1fe90ee33ea71230e6","amp;dn":"Better+Than+Ezra-Before+The+Robots-%28Advance%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91be2db3d999d30eb01c0a1fe90ee33ea71230e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,190,45,179,217,153,211,14,176,28,10,31,233,14,227,62,167,18,48,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
