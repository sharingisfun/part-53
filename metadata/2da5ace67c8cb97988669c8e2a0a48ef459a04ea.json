Blue Note's vast catalog gives them a huge advantage over several similar groups in terms of source material, and classic sounds by Art Blakey, Horace Silver, and Herbie Hancock provide zest and fiber to their narratives. Indeed, when things falter, it's because the raps aren't always that creative. They are serviceable and sometimes catchy, but too often delivered without the snazzy touches or distinctive skills that make Quest and Gang Starr's material top-notch. But when words and music mesh, as on &quot;Cantaloop&quot; or &quot;The Darkside,&quot; Us3 show how effectively hip-hop and jazz can blend. \n\nTracks :\n\n1. Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)\n2.
