The solid rhythm section and competent keyboard playing give the album a very high quality and the eight tracks are all perfectly enjoyable.\nTwo album tracks were also released as a single, the opening track, L'indecisione and the instrumental guitar-driven Turba, but with no success. Among the other album tracks, a mention for Consiglio, with keyboards in evidence and a very good vocal part.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½-IP\n\nNote of interest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elio Volpini was later (1975) in Etna.\nYou think the cover was an influence for the future poster for the film Alien? haha:)\n\nEnjoy!\nBrainticket\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40faf91b8670125016085e4b95cec7204d7eac16","amp;dn":"L%5C%27Uovo+Di+Colombo+-+s%2Ft+%28Italian+Prog+1973%29%28256%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40faf91b8670125016085e4b95cec7204d7eac16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,250,249,27,134,112,18,80,22,8,94,75,149,206,199,32,77,126,172,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
