Discipline. Excellence. \n        \n        These young men are accomplished athletes, disciplined in \n        wide range of mixed martial arts that include wrestling, \n        boxing, judo, Jiu-Jitsu, karate and kickboxing. Each has\n        the dream, the hope, and the will to fight in an Ultimate\n        Fighting Championship event. Only one fighter from each \n        of the two weight classes will succeed with the challenge. \n         \n        During the show the competitors will take their training \n        to a higher level. They will be brought to Las Vegas where\n        the UFC brand has its National Training Center. For the \n        next seven weeks the competitors will be under the strict\n        supervision of two of the most successful and famous UFC\n        fighters and trainers on the planet, UFC Light Heavyweight\n        Champion Randy Couture and UFC Light Heavyweight #1 Contender\n        Chuck Liddell. \n        \n        The competitors will endure the most grueling training and\n        intense pressure of their lives. They will train together,\n        live together, and fight against each other inside and outside\n        of the storied UFC Octagon. The men are split into two teams,\n        Team Liddell and Team Couture. The two squads compete against\n        each other within their weight classes to avoid elimination. \n        \n        In each episode, the competitors will also compete in a \n        &amp;quot;Challenge.&amp;quot; The Challenges are designed to push the fighters\n        to the edge of their physical and mental capabilities. The \n        Challenges revolve around old school training techniques, \n        physical stamina, and mental strategy. The team that wins the\n        challenge controls which fighters must fight to avoid elimination. \n         \n        At the end of each week, one fighter from each team must fight in\n        the Octagon to avoid being kicked out of the UFC Training Center\n        until only two remain in each weight division. In the end, The \n        Ultimate Fighter will be decided by a competition match \n        -- a head-to-head fight to the finish inside the Octagon. \n        \n        The weak are eliminated... \n          \n        The strong will survive... \n         \n        Only one will be left standing from each weight class... \n        \n        The Ultimate Fighter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c31f852c34c1e33aa1054c3899820e9573f1c26","amp;dn":"The.Ultimate.Fighter.S01E02.DSRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c31f852c34c1e33aa1054c3899820e9573f1c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,49,248,82,195,76,30,51,170,16,84,195,137,152,32,233,87,63,28,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
