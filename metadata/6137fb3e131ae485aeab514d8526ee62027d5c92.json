The story is set during a critical time for the human colonists as the war against the Cylons is coming to close. Adama has recently been assigned to the Galactica as a pilot and gamers play through the events that will shape the man who will later be Commander Adama, the captain of the last Battlestar leading a ragtag fleet of humans to their fabled homeworld called Earth. The game, developed by Warthog, is based on the 2003 Sci-Fi channel miniseries. \n\n\nGame Info\n\nDeveloper Warthog  \nPublisher Sierra  \nGenre Action \nRelease Date November 18, 2003  \nESRB Teen  \nGameSpy Score N/A  \nMultiplayer Unknown  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6137fb3e131ae485aeab514d8526ee62027d5c92","amp;dn":"Xbox+-+RLT+-+Battlestar+Galactica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6137fb3e131ae485aeab514d8526ee62027d5c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,55,251,62,19,26,228,133,174,171,81,77,133,38,238,98,2,125,92,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
