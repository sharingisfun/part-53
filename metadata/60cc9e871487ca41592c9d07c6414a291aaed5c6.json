Not their best known work, but not at all a bad album. Hawkwind had to change their name to Hawklords for legal reasons, maybe because Dave Brock was the only original member. \n\nAfter a brief respite, he and Calvert regrouped with a new rhythm section (Harvey Bainbridge on bass, Martin Griffin on drums), and a new name: The Sonic Assassins. Steve Swindells (ex-Pilot... &quot;Oh ho ho it's magic, y'know, never believe it's not so.&quot;) then joined on keyboards and the name transmogrified yet again to: Hawklords. \n\nThe 'lords recorded 25 YEARS ON with King and House fluttering about in the periphery contributing the odd bit here and the nice bit there. This is a challenging album -- the songwriting is strong and you have to commend Brock and Calvert for trying to move in a new direction, picking up some of the power pop/punk/new wave aura of the day.\n\nNow if someone would upload pinkwind, Xhawkwind or the hawkestra bootleg it would really make my day :D\n\n256kbs\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Psi Power\n2. Free Fall\n3. Autumoton\n4. 25 Years\n5. Flying Doctor\n6. The Only Ones\n7. Only The Dead Dreams Of A Cold War Kid\n8. The Age Of The Micro Man\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60cc9e871487ca41592c9d07c6414a291aaed5c6","amp;dn":"Hawklords+%28aka+Hawkwind%29+-+25+Years+On+%28UK+Spacerock+1978+%40256%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60cc9e871487ca41592c9d07c6414a291aaed5c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,204,158,135,20,135,202,65,89,44,157,7,198,65,74,41,26,174,213,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
