I believe this to be the best unheard Blues album ever recorded. F. Cramer basicallt recorded C&amp;W. Hard driving piano accompanied with sax, trumpet, etc. DL &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Never Be Free&quot; to best sample this album. Excellent fidelity and Stereo imaging ripped from CD employing VBR / Highest Quality / Multiple Sampling\n\nNOTE: Sentimental Journey was not on the original Hello Blues album and I have no idea why it was added with the release of the CD. It&amp;#039;s certainly not a blues arrangemnt and has no business on this album. Delete It!!\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e62a24242c2cf3dd739a66fd94750441ab6aa2","amp;dn":"Floyd+Cramer+-+Hello+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e62a24242c2cf3dd739a66fd94750441ab6aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,230,42,36,36,44,44,243,221,115,154,102,253,148,117,4,65,171,106,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
