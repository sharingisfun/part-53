She does all she can to make this happen, and comes very close to succeeding, but in the end her plan is thwarted by her sensible parents. So she runs away, still determined to get pregnant one way or another, but instead finds herself lost in another world, a less sensible one, perhaps, but one pregnant itself with all sorts of strange possibility. She takes a road trip from the suburbs of New Jersey, through Ohio to the plains of Kansas and back. Like so many trips, this one is round-trip, and it's hard to say in the end if she can ever be quite the same again, or if she can ever be anything but the same again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e7a8e5dbef6b334b6a048ff0b82006a91af180","amp;dn":"Palindromes+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e7a8e5dbef6b334b6a048ff0b82006a91af180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,231,168,229,219,239,107,51,75,106,4,143,240,184,32,6,169,26,241,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
