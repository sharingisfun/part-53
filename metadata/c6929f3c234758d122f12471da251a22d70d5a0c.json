I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I seed the second out of 7 Depeche Mode albums I currently have as Flac. For the upcoming week there'll be one new Depeche album every day. So stay tuned =)\n\nNote that FLAC is NOT a lossy format such as Mp3s which might injur your HiFi equipment badly. FLAC is nothing but the best and without all the DRM enabled crap Apple and Microsoft push out these days.\n\nIf you don't know about FLAC or why it is the future, head over to http://flac.sf.net and get convinced yourself.\n_____________________\nDepeche Mode - Construction Time Again (1983)\n\n\nTracklist\n\n01.

Construction Time Again, the new line-up's first full effort, is a bit hit and miss nonetheless, but when it does hit, it does so perfectly. Right from the album's first song, &amp;quot;Love in Itself,&amp;quot; something is clearly up; Depeche never sounded quite so thick with its sound before, with synths arranged into a mini-orchestra/horn section and real piano and acoustic guitar spliced in at strategic points. Two tracks later, &amp;quot;Pipeline&amp;quot; offers the first clear hint of an increasing industrial influence (the band members were early fans of EinstÃ…Â¸rzende Neubauten), with clattering metal samples and oddly chain gang-like lyrics and vocals. The album's clear highlight has to be &amp;quot;Everything Counts,&amp;quot; a live staple for years, combining a deceptively simple, ironic lyric about the music business with a perfectly catchy but unusually arranged blending of more metallic scraping samples and melodica amid even more forceful funk/hip-hop beats. Elsewhere, on &amp;quot;Shame&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Told You So,&amp;quot; Gore's lyrics start taking on more of the obsessive personal relationship studies that would soon dominate his writing. Wilder's own songwriting contributions are fine musically, but lyrically, &amp;quot;preachy&amp;quot; puts it mildly, especially the environment-friendly &amp;quot;The Landscape Is Changing.&amp;quot;\n\n\nExtraction Info\n\nExtraxted: EAC\nUsed drive  : Lite-on LTR-52327S   Adapter: 1  ID: 0\nRead mode   : Secure with NO C2, accurate stream, disable cache\nRead offset correction : 6\nOverread into Lead-In and Lead-Out : Yes\n\nUsed output format : Internal WAV Routines\n                     44.100 Hz; 16 Bit; Stereo\n\nOther options      : \n    Fill up missing offset samples with silence : Yes\n    Delete leading and trailing silent blocks : No\n    Native Win32 interface for Win NT &amp;amp; 2000\n\nConverted: Converted: flac - Command-line FLAC encoder/decoder version 1.1.1 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002,2003  Josh Coalson\n\nLog, FLAC and WAV cue and playlist, FLAC fingerprint\n\n\n******************************************** \n\nPlease remember to upload as much as you download\n\n\n...::BE FAIR AND SHARE::... \n\n********************************************\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6929f3c234758d122f12471da251a22d70d5a0c","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Construction+Time+Again+%281983%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6929f3c234758d122f12471da251a22d70d5a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,146,159,60,35,71,88,209,34,241,36,113,218,37,26,34,215,13,90,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
