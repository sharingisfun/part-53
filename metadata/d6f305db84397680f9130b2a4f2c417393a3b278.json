It was an immediate\n success in America and England, and was Melville?s most popular \nwork during his lifetime. It was not until the end of the 1930?s that \nit was surpassed in popularity by Moby Dick, more than thirty years \nafter his death. The story provoked harsh criticism for its \ncondemnation of missionary efforts in the Pacific Islands. Many \nsought to discredit the book, claiming that it was a work of fiction, \nbut this criticism ended when the events it described were \ncorroborated by Melville?s fellow castaway, Richard T. Greene, who \nappears in the story as the character Toby (Summary by Michael)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f305db84397680f9130b2a4f2c417393a3b278","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+Typee+-+Herman+Melville+%5BLibrivox%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f305db84397680f9130b2a4f2c417393a3b278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,243,5,219,132,57,118,128,249,19,11,42,79,44,65,115,147,163,178,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
