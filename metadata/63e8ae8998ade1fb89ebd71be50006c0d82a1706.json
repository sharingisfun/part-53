It also aims to provide an easy way to carry out admin tasks on your computer, such as creating and editing the partitions of the hard disk. It contains a lot of system utilities (parted, partimage, fstools, ...) and basic ones (editors, midnight commander, network tools). It aims to be very easy to use: just boot from the cdrom, and you can do everything. The kernel of the system supports most important file systems (ext2/ext3, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs, jfs, vfat, ntfs, iso9660), and network ones (samba and nfs).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e8ae8998ade1fb89ebd71be50006c0d82a1706","amp;dn":"System+Rescue+CD+x86+0.2.18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e8ae8998ade1fb89ebd71be50006c0d82a1706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,232,174,137,152,173,225,251,137,235,215,27,229,0,6,192,216,42,23,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
