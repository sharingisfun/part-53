A total of 5,195 of the type were built, 127 by Mitsubishi, when production completely ceased in 1979.  The prototype was first flown on May 27, 1958 and held great promise in a variety of roles.  The aircraft was so appealing that the USAF signed up for the type as well.  Phantoms set many world records during their prime, and many remain in service throughout the world.\n\nFeatures ;\n\n- two-model set: F-4B and F-4J\n- two textures sets per model: VF-51 CAG, VF-111, VF-114, VMFA-333\n- reflective, high-detail textures\n- afterburner flames, blue jetpipe flames and wingtip vortices effects\n- detailed 2D panel with mousable xml-type gauges\n- togglable HUD, adjustable for brightness\n- working 'radar' effect\n- highly authentic performance, afterburner power either by keypress or panel switch\n- pop-up panels for GPS, radios and ECU\n- authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable gauges\n- animated folding wings (F key)\n- animated tailhook (T key)\n- animated drag chute (Concorde Visor keys)\n- animated afterburner nozzle petals\n- animated canopies (front/rear independent)\n- 2 realistic crew figures, animated pilot's head\n- authentic undercarriage structure and animations\n- working landing lights, strobes, nav and beacons\n\n==================================================================\n\nAnother Install And Fly Release .\n\nPack Includes promotional video , paintkit , screenshots and manual which are offered on a multiple choice installer with full uninstall support .\n\nHappy Hunting ;)\nTurkish_Gladio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8574dee428d2efb3de21f2f84e2f608357de7003","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+F4+Phantom+II+%28+AlphaSim+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8574dee428d2efb3de21f2f84e2f608357de7003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,116,222,228,40,210,239,179,222,33,242,248,78,47,96,131,87,222,112,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
