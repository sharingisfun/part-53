We have another wonderful piece of shit re-edit, crushkill style. \n\nI took the wonderfully realistic 1995 hollywood blockbuster, Hackers, and re-edited it so Jonny Lee Miller (AKA Zero Cool / Crash Override) DIES at the very beginning.\n\nThis doesnt change the structure of the film in its essence, it merely cuts the movie from its original 01:45:22 time to 00:4:55!\n\nWe all hated Zero Cool and his pompous fucking attitude, his generalized explanations of hacking 3D GUI Unix Servers, and his eventual match with Jolie. \n\nThis movie was a little harder to edit, mostly because the director (Iain Softley) used alot of flashy techniques and editing style, which is very different from my usual fanfare of Arnold Schwarzenegger edits.\n\nAlso, I've extended the much talked about BOOBIE scene from 0.05 seconds to about 25 seconds. The actual boobie exposure is really minimal, but I hoped that slowing down the actual scene would at least increase the appreciation for her leap into the world of boobie exposure.\n\nIf you have trouble viewing the video, you might want to install the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.divx.com/divx/play/download/&quot; target=&quot;_Blank&quot;&gt;DiVX codec&lt;/a&gt;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf4e49cd9b69ad51984d012cb209fb2d83577ef8","amp;dn":"Hackers+%281995%29%2C+RE-EDITED+%28fan+film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf4e49cd9b69ad51984d012cb209fb2d83577ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,78,73,205,155,105,173,81,152,77,1,44,178,9,251,45,131,87,126,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
