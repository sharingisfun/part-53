In Cheers: The Complete First Season, youÃ‚Â´ll find all 22 complete, uncut episodes of the showÃ‚Â´s premiere season and see how this milestone TV comedy series began. Former pro baseball player Sam &quot;Mayday&quot; Malone (Ted Danson) enjoys a playboy lifestyle as the proprietor of the neighborhood hangout, assisted by his befuddled bartender, Coach (Nicholas Colasanto), and his surly waitress, Carla (Rhea Perlman). Cheers also has Norm (George Wendt) and Cliff (John Ratzenberger) - two of the funniest barflies youÃ‚Â´ll ever encounter. And completing the showÃ‚Â´s ensemble cast is Shelley Long as Diane Chambers, a teaching assistant who suddenly finds herself jilted, jobless - and hired as SamÃ‚Â´s newest waitress! A hearty round of laughs is served up in each episode of TVÃ‚Â´s classic comedy hit...Cheers!\n\nVideo Reencoded with rebuilder + HC 2 pass\n\nEnjoy\n\nOther release of DVDQuorum.es\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac662bc97bd2f48ba0720bd39bf1be03c92c4dc","amp;dn":"Cheers+Seasson+2+DVD+1+Eng%2FSpa+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac662bc97bd2f48ba0720bd39bf1be03c92c4dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,198,98,188,151,189,47,72,186,7,32,189,57,191,27,224,60,146,196,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
