We may be familiar to some of you from our mixes from\n  a couple of years back - 90s Ambient Techno and Trance 1 &amp; 2, 90s Acid \n  and Live Breaks 2002.  And then we disappeared...  Well we&amp;#039;re back with\n  a load of new and archive stuff, spanning various genres and eras from \n  the melodic side of progressive house to the all out percussion headmash \n  of the best techno has to offer (that&amp;#039;s not to mean we&amp;#039;re just 4/4 - the\n  breaks are all in here too).  \n\n  So What All This Then??  \n\n  In the mean time here is a little taste of what we&amp;#039;ve been up to - a \n  short and dirty mix to keep you bouncing about this summer.  From the \n  stomps and breaks of Peace Division and Switch, through the beeps and \n  blurts of Sander K and those abrasive gauls The Micronauts to the \n  building, explosive funk of Rob Babicz and Valentino Kanzyani, we hope \n  we&amp;#039;ve created a mix that is the aural equivalent of chewing a disco \n  biscuit - up for it, cheeky and quick to kick in!  Perfect for those \n  times you just don&amp;#039;t have time for those 2 hour DJ sets - Enjoy :)\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n  Group Info:                                                             \n                                                                          \n  Aquasonic DJs have been playing out for the last 12 years, in various   \n  forms of music from techno, d&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;b, breaks and more.  We intend to       \n  bring you mixes from all areas of dance, and from different generations.\n\n  Thanks and Shouts:\n\n  Surgeon, The Mixing Bowl, our known associates...\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Contact:\n\n  www.onepointsixone.com (currently being rebuilt but keep checking!)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03b65d1db60f8d5564a9a6d216f0dfb990b25e2a","amp;dn":"Aquasonic+DJs+Presents+A+Little+Teaser+for+2006+%5BTechno%2FBreak%2FBl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03b65d1db60f8d5564a9a6d216f0dfb990b25e2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,182,93,29,182,15,141,85,100,169,166,210,22,240,223,185,144,178,94,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
