No EVIL No VIRUS.\n\n                     \\&quot;the batch file\\&quot; RIGHT CLICK CLICK EDIT everything being done is right there every step\n                     of the installation.\n                     \\&quot;the registry file\\&quot; was just explained in the above paragraphs.its a registry entry to\n                     hide the gui when starting the application at logon.The 1st run of the application\n                     you will get a popup because the application is not configured yet,after that it will start  \n                     without bothering you.\n\n          here is an example of the no GUI trick.(note it doesn\\&amp;#039;t work with every application)\n          EXAMPLE:make Windows Media Player the default for mp3 playback,place an mp3 on your desktop\n          click&gt;start&gt;run&gt;type cmd&gt;hit enter type in      cd desktop &amp;start /min your.mp3   \n          Windows Media Player is now playing your mp3 without a GUI.\n          no EVIL no VIRUS just a nice feature of Windows XP.\n\n         People may look at hide.exe as a hacktool if it was rest assured that my up to date\n         Symantec anti-virus would have flagged it. Besides I got this from a system admin friend of\n         mine who uses it to hide the logon scripts from his users on a windows network.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9771282b279671240ae9d16f7b46f354d50b49a7","amp;dn":"trayapp%28reseed%29.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9771282b279671240ae9d16f7b46f354d50b49a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,113,40,43,39,150,113,36,10,233,209,111,123,70,243,84,213,11,73,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
