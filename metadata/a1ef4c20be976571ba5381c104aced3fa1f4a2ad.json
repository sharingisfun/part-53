Powell, who held the top military job at the Pentagon under President George H.W. Bush and other powerful posts at the highest levels of government, is a cautious realist who represents the establishment&amp;#039;s abiding belief in diplomacy and the containment of foreign enemies. Wolfowitz, who built a career as a smart and tough hardliner at the Departments of State and Defense, champions the idea of preemption, striking first to defend America and to project its democratic values.\n\nAt the time the Gulf War ended in 1991, Powell was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Wolfowitz was deputy secretary of defense for policy, the third-highest ranking civilian in then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney&amp;#039;s Pentagon. Powell was instrumental in stopping the war short of going to Baghdad and removing Saddam Hussein. Wolfowitz and other hardliners were less than enthusiastic about that decision.\n\nMore info here: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/synopsis.html\n\nWMV File Details\n=====================================================================================\nName.........: PBS Frontline (Feb 2003) The War Behind Closed Doors (53m40s) ConRes.wmv\nFilesize.....: 93.2 MB (97,795,141 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:52:40 \nVideo Codec..: None (ASF .wmv file)\nVideo Bitrate: 241 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: None\nAudio Bitrate: 195 kb/s\nFrame Size...: 320x240\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nPeace :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ef4c20be976571ba5381c104aced3fa1f4a2ad","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline+%28Feb+2003%29+The+War+Behind+Closed+Doors+%2853m40s%29.wm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ef4c20be976571ba5381c104aced3fa1f4a2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,239,76,32,190,151,101,113,186,83,129,193,4,172,237,63,161,244,162,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
