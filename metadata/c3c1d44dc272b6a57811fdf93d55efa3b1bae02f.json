Wynton, perhaps because of his father's presence, is very respectful of the melodies, sometimes overly so. The result is that this set is not as adventurous as one would like although Marsalis's beautiful tone makes the music worth hearing. \n \n\n\n \n       1  In the Court of King Oliver  Marsalis  4:31  \n       2  Never Let Me Go  Evans, Livingston  1:46  \n       3  Street of Dreams  Lewis, Young  4:07  \n       4  Where or When  Hart, Rodgers  2:50  \n       5  Bona and Paul  Marsalis  1:46  \n       6  The Seductress  Marsalis  2:55  \n       7  A Sleepin' Bee  Arlen, Capote  3:15  \n       8  Big Butter and Egg Man  Armstrong, Venable  4:45  \n       9  The Very Thought of You  Noble  5:36  \n       10  I Cover the Waterfront  Green, Heyman  4:52  \n       11  How Are Things in Glocca Morra?
