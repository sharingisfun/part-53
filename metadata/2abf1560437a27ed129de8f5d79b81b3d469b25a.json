I'm not much of a programmer, so it's not perfect, but it \n; works for private servers. If you can do it better, then do so :p \n; Note that this patch will not list your game in the public lists \n; (Why? Cause it's a PRiVATE server patch, duh ;)) \n\nINSTALL NOTES \n\n1) Extract the contents of ind-cod2psp.zip to your CoD2 folder \n; 2) In your CoD2 dir, use patch.exe to replace CoD2MP_s.exe with the \n; one I modified \n; 3) Fire up CoD2 and start a server. Your friends can now connect \n; directly to your IP to join the game without having their CDKey \n; checked by Activision \n; 4) If you want everything back to normal, use unpatch.exe, the \n; original CoD2MP_s.exe will then be put back in place \n; \n; THANKS GO TO \n\nDEViANCE for their release of CoD2 which made me able to bring you \n; this patch. Good to have you back DEViANCE, you're doing fine work \n; once again ! =).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2abf1560437a27ed129de8f5d79b81b3d469b25a","amp;dn":"Call.of.Duty.2.PRiVATE.SERVER.PATCH-iND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2abf1560437a27ed129de8f5d79b81b3d469b25a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,191,21,96,67,122,39,237,18,157,232,245,215,155,129,179,212,105,178,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
