Born in Ivory Coast, he's currently exiled in Mali. His constant fight against Laurent Bagbo's dictatorship, the french neo-colonialism, the cancellation of Third-World debt and the new US military implantations are the main themes of his work. Here in France, and especially in Brittany (i'm a breton, wich is quite different from a french...), Tiken Jah is considered as the new Africa's herald. \nMore infos on www.tikenjah.net\n\nSongs are in french, english &amp; dioula (native language of ppl in parts of Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso &amp; Togo)\n\nTrack List\t\tDur.\tApprox. translation\n\n01 - D&amp;eacute;livrance\t\t3:35\t(Liberation)\n02 - Plus jamais &amp;ccedil;a\t3:50\t(Never again)\n03 - Le Descendant\t         4:26\t(same as in french)\n04 - Don\t\t         4:27\t(Gift)\n05 - Mangercratie\t         4:12\t(something like 'Foodocracy')\n06 - Djeli\t\t4:39\n07 - Crazy World\t         4:00\n08 - Le Descendant(dub)\t4:38\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7033c3230e9e6b2db9bcd2e84ea46d66dcfa0dc7","amp;dn":"Tiken+Jah+Fakoly+-+Mangercratie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7033c3230e9e6b2db9bcd2e84ea46d66dcfa0dc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,51,195,35,14,158,107,45,185,188,210,232,78,164,109,102,220,250,13,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
