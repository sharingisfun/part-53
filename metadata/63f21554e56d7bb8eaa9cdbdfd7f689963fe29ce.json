A teenage girl, Alison Cook, goes missing after coming home from school early, and Frost fears she may have been a victim of a serial rapist who has been active in Denton in recent months. Frost has been at pains to help the victims, and revisits some of them to try to find a new lead, and uncovers a connection with the father of the missing teenager. Higher authorities in the police force add to the pressure by threatening to replace him on the case, which leads him to try a desperate measure of using WPC Hazel Wallace as a decoy, but it exposes her to serious danger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f21554e56d7bb8eaa9cdbdfd7f689963fe29ce","amp;dn":"A+Touch+Of+Frost+-+2x04+-++Stranger+In+The+House%281994%29+avi+torre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f21554e56d7bb8eaa9cdbdfd7f689963fe29ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,242,21,84,229,109,123,184,234,169,205,189,253,127,104,153,99,254,41,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
