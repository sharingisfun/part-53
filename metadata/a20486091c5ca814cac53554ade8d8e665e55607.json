In   \n  1995 they released a 5-track EP on Distant Recordings called\n  The Undiscovered Numbers &amp; Colors, which was described by   \n  some as &quot;Earth Crisis meets Rush.&quot;                          \n  In 1996, they decided to start another band called Oil.     \n  After some confusion with a New York band also named Oil,   \n  Deron changed the name to Camp Kill Yourself. In 1998,      \n  Jess's brother Bam, a pro skateboarder, was featured on Toy \n  Machine's video &quot;Jump Off A Building,&quot; so during &quot;Bam's Park\n  Footy,&quot; they played the band's song &quot;Genesis 12a.&quot;  In the  \n  credits there was contact info on how to get more CKY       \n  recordings. Bam's antics in &quot;Jump Off A Building&quot; were loved\n  by viewers, so he released a full-length video of them      \n  through Landspeed Wheels called &quot;Landspeed: cKy&quot; in March   \n  1999. He needed a soundtrack, so he gathered up all the     \n  songs CKY had and used them in the video, and they recorded \n  a few extra songs just for the video.  Deron and Jess added \n  Ryan Bruni to the band on bass because Deron worked with him\n  at UPS.  When they went to Groundhog studios to record the  \n  album, they recruited Chad Ginsburg from the band Rudy &amp;    \n  Blitz on guitars.  Chad was producing the album and joined  \n  the band at their request.  They released &quot;Camp Kill        \n  Yourself: Volume 1&quot; on Teil Martin International, and &quot;Camp \n  Kill Yourself: Volume 2,&quot; which was prank calls and songs   \n  that were on the video but didn't make it onto Volume 1,    \n  plus some extras. They both sold out quickly. The band went \n  on the 1999 Warped Tour and played for Volcom, but were     \n  kicked off after a protest in St. Louis over the prices the \n  tour's vendors were charging. By this time, they had become \n  superstars in the skateboarding world. In late summer, they \n  were signed to the Volcom Entertainment record label, and   \n  released a re-mastered Volume 1 in December.                \n  In February 2000, Ryan Bruni was out of the band. According \n  to some, he left because he didn't get along with Jess, and \n  others say he was kicked out because he didn't really       \n  contribute to the band (Deron played most of the bass on    \n  Volume 1). Then Volcom's lawyers were afraid of some people \n  being offended by the band's name, as well as the album     \n  cover (a drawing of Bud Dywer, a politician who killed      \n  himself on live TV in the 1980s).  So Volcom changed the    \n  band's name to Camp and changed the album's artwork and on  \n  04.01.00 released &quot;CAMP: cKy&quot; but no one liked the new name.\n  So after some pushing, the band was able to get its name    \n  changed to simply CKY. In May, Volcom rereleased the album  \n  AGAIN with the same art as CAMP: cKy, but on the tray they  \n  changed it to say cKy: CAMP. After the video CKY2K had come \n  out, CKY had been exposed to people across the world. Even  \n  Limp Bizkit, Green Day, and Blink-182 became fans. CKY      \n  played the Warped Tour again that summer, but didn't get to \n  play the West Coast. They released a limited edition EP,    \n  &quot;Disengage The Simulator,&quot; for the Warped Tour. It sold out \n  after 2 months. Without a bassist, Chad had been forced to  \n  play bass all through the Warped Tour until July, when they \n  found bass player Vern Zaborowski and recruited him into the\n  band. In October 2000, Bam became part of the hit MTV show  \n  &quot;Jackass,&quot; and some of the band's music was played, such as \n  &quot;96 Quite Bitter Beings,&quot; &quot;Genesis 12a,&quot; and &quot;Shippensburg.&quot;\n  CKY was reaching out to even more people, and so Volcom     \n  released what would be the FINAL incarnation of the album:  \n  &quot;cKy: Camp Volume 1.&quot; With CKY's music taking over MTV on   \n  &quot;Jackass,&quot; it was time for them to hit the big time: to hit \n  TRL. Many people were saying it would be a bad thing and    \n  that MTV sucks, but it was decided that the reason the fans \n  don't like MTV is because MTV doesn't play the kind of music\n  they like, and if CKY started putting their videos on MTV,  \n  it would make it better. On December, MTV played the &quot;96    \n  Quite Bitter Beings&quot; video on a show called &quot;HotZone,&quot; and  \n  it was filled with footage from &quot;Jackass.&quot;  Fans were       \n  disappointed, but the band told them that the video didn't  \n  matter, the important thing was the music.                  \n\n\n       k l u d g e . s o u n d   n o t e s\n\n  KLUdGE is a mature group that came  together from  the best and\n  oldest roots  of the mpeg layer  scene.

In   \n  1995 they released a 5-track EP on Distant Recordings called\n  The Undiscovered Numbers &amp; Colors, which was described by   \n  some as &quot;Earth Crisis meets Rush.&quot;                          \n  In 1996, they decided to start another band called Oil.     \n  After some confusion with a New York band also named Oil,   \n  Deron changed the name to Camp Kill Yourself. In 1998,      \n  Jess's brother Bam, a pro skateboarder, was featured on Toy \n  Machine's video &quot;Jump Off A Building,&quot; so during &quot;Bam's Park\n  Footy,&quot; they played the band's song &quot;Genesis 12a.&quot;  In the  \n  credits there was contact info on how to get more CKY       \n  recordings. Bam's antics in &quot;Jump Off A Building&quot; were loved\n  by viewers, so he released a full-length video of them      \n  through Landspeed Wheels called &quot;Landspeed: cKy&quot; in March   \n  1999. He needed a soundtrack, so he gathered up all the     \n  songs CKY had and used them in the video, and they recorded \n  a few extra songs just for the video.  Deron and Jess added \n  Ryan Bruni to the band on bass because Deron worked with him\n  at UPS.  When they went to Groundhog studios to record the  \n  album, they recruited Chad Ginsburg from the band Rudy &amp;    \n  Blitz on guitars.  Chad was producing the album and joined  \n  the band at their request.  They released &quot;Camp Kill        \n  Yourself: Volume 1&quot; on Teil Martin International, and &quot;Camp \n  Kill Yourself: Volume 2,&quot; which was prank calls and songs   \n  that were on the video but didn't make it onto Volume 1,    \n  plus some extras. They both sold out quickly. The band went \n  on the 1999 Warped Tour and played for Volcom, but were     \n  kicked off after a protest in St. Louis over the prices the \n  tour's vendors were charging. By this time, they had become \n  superstars in the skateboarding world. In late summer, they \n  were signed to the Volcom Entertainment record label, and   \n  released a re-mastered Volume 1 in December.                \n  In February 2000, Ryan Bruni was out of the band. According \n  to some, he left because he didn't get along with Jess, and \n  others say he was kicked out because he didn't really       \n  contribute to the band (Deron played most of the bass on    \n  Volume 1). Then Volcom's lawyers were afraid of some people \n  being offended by the band's name, as well as the album     \n  cover (a drawing of Bud Dywer, a politician who killed      \n  himself on live TV in the 1980s).  So Volcom changed the    \n  band's name to Camp and changed the album's artwork and on  \n  04.01.00 released &quot;CAMP: cKy&quot; but no one liked the new name.\n  So after some pushing, the band was able to get its name    \n  changed to simply CKY. In May, Volcom rereleased the album  \n  AGAIN with the same art as CAMP: cKy, but on the tray they  \n  changed it to say cKy: CAMP. After the video CKY2K had come \n  out, CKY had been exposed to people across the world. Even  \n  Limp Bizkit, Green Day, and Blink-182 became fans. CKY      \n  played the Warped Tour again that summer, but didn't get to \n  play the West Coast. They released a limited edition EP,    \n  &quot;Disengage The Simulator,&quot; for the Warped Tour. It sold out \n  after 2 months. Without a bassist, Chad had been forced to  \n  play bass all through the Warped Tour until July, when they \n  found bass player Vern Zaborowski and recruited him into the\n  band. In October 2000, Bam became part of the hit MTV show  \n  &quot;Jackass,&quot; and some of the band's music was played, such as \n  &quot;96 Quite Bitter Beings,&quot; &quot;Genesis 12a,&quot; and &quot;Shippensburg.&quot;\n  CKY was reaching out to even more people, and so Volcom     \n  released what would be the FINAL incarnation of the album:  \n  &quot;cKy: Camp Volume 1.&quot; With CKY's music taking over MTV on   \n  &quot;Jackass,&quot; it was time for them to hit the big time: to hit \n  TRL. Many people were saying it would be a bad thing and    \n  that MTV sucks, but it was decided that the reason the fans \n  don't like MTV is because MTV doesn't play the kind of music\n  they like, and if CKY started putting their videos on MTV,  \n  it would make it better. On December, MTV played the &quot;96    \n  Quite Bitter Beings&quot; video on a show called &quot;HotZone,&quot; and  \n  it was filled with footage from &quot;Jackass.&quot;  Fans were       \n  disappointed, but the band told the                         \n\n\n       k l u d g e . s o u n d   n o t e s\n\n  KLUdGE is a mature group that came  together from  the best and\n  oldest roots  of the mpeg layer  scene.  Since the time of cda,\n  much has evolved and changed into what mpeg3 is known as today.\n  KSi is  this new  group that  only rips the  best out there and\n  only what we feel needs to be ripped. KSi continues to grow and\n  strives to find the best music for the people. We thank all the\n  supporters  and groups  that have  helped us  get where  we are\n  today.
