For 35 years it has remained one of my favourite movies; perhaps the number one. Nothing in particular about the film so qualifies it. I like quite a number of &quot;better&quot; films, but KOH touched me in a way that stuck. It is an authentic movie; the reality is as simple as the english speaking english, the french french, and the germans german. The crazy people are sane, the sane people crazy. It is funny and tragic and perhaps a little too quirky but ... if you haven't tried it on you should.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86ad2842fc999e0595496f0f3c4b15d2f1b9f61","amp;dn":"King_of_Hearts_DivX6_eng_sub.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86ad2842fc999e0595496f0f3c4b15d2f1b9f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,106,210,132,47,201,153,224,89,84,150,240,243,196,177,93,47,27,159,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
