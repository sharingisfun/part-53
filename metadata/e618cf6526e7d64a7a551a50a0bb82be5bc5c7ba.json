Divided roadways and highways are displayed in their correct positioning for both sides, not just as a single line using a divided road texture. You will see roads the way they are supposed to look! This is invaluable for those VFR flights where you need road and highway landmarks to help you navigate. Now you can take off low and slow in the Piper Cub from the tip of Florida, across the central plains, up through the northwest mountain regions, and all the way to Seattle, with just USA Roads and a road map.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e618cf6526e7d64a7a551a50a0bb82be5bc5c7ba","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Flight+1+USA+Roads+-+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e618cf6526e7d64a7a551a50a0bb82be5bc5c7ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,24,207,101,38,231,214,74,122,85,26,80,160,187,130,190,91,197,199,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
