It runs lightning fast on anything 600Mhz and higher with 128MB or RAM or more but I have stripped this version down so that it can be run on anything with as little as 64MB RAM and a 266Mhz processor.\n\nIt contains only the bare minimum services and support to run: audio, print, networking. Most services have been disabled or set to 'manual'. It contains SP2 and will autoupdate without a problem.\n\nYou can do an unattended install and do not have to worry about entering a product key or activation.\n\nThe iso is only 113Mb and will easily fit onto any pocket CD with plenty of room to spare. The full install will only take less than 200MB space.\n\nEnjoy this lightning fast Xtremely stripped down version of XP Pro w/SP2 that I have labeled the 'Barenaked Version'. It is as light a version of Windows as you will ever find.\n\nPhil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbdfb5bb6d6c9e4fa7698398bc717a4b1a867487","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Pro+Lite+Xtreme+w%2FSP2+%5BBarenaked+Version%5D+reseeded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbdfb5bb6d6c9e4fa7698398bc717a4b1a867487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,223,181,187,109,108,158,79,167,105,131,152,188,113,122,75,26,134,116,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
