Superb soundtracks. Play it on an emu.\n\nNote: One of the mp3 file is corrupt and will hang the game. I don't know which one. When you know which then just don't play that tune or replace it with your custom tune or repair it.\n\n/Frezzno\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d0aaf987f493fcd0092af1fb5fa67dd9d8aa65","amp;dn":"Jaguar+xj220+%28U%29%5BSEGA+CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d0aaf987f493fcd0092af1fb5fa67dd9d8aa65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,208,170,249,135,244,147,252,208,9,42,241,251,95,166,125,217,216,170,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
