Expecting to find her late mother's house abandoned, Pursy is shocked to discover that it is inhabited by two of her mother's friends: Bobby Long, a former literature professor, and his young protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, Lawson Pines. These broken men, whose lives took a wrong turn years before, have been firmly rooted in the dilapidated house for years, encouraged only by Lawson's faltering ambitions to write a novel about Bobby Long's life. Having no intention of leaving, Pursy, Bobby Long and Lawson are all forced to live together. Yet as time passes, their tenuous, makeshift arrangement unearths a series of buried personal secrets that challenges their bonds, and reveals just how inextricably their lives are intertwined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f5e01ee97dfb6f39a9f519abb676dce339f337","amp;dn":"A+Love+Song+For+Bobby+Long","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f5e01ee97dfb6f39a9f519abb676dce339f337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,245,224,30,233,125,251,111,57,169,245,25,171,182,118,220,227,57,243,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
