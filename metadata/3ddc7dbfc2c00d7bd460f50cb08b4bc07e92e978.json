Drawing deep from Adler's own experience on the Cincinnati club circuit of the late '60s, where he gigged alongside (and frequently jammed with members of) R&amp;B legends Dyke &amp; the Blazers and Bootsy Collins' Pacesetters, Roogalator offered an angular, minimalist funk sound which was utterly at odds with the country, blues, and early rock sounds normally heard on the scene. Even Kokomo, up to that point the most authentic attempt at a homegrown funk sound yet unveiled, trailed in Roogalator's slipstream. They, after all, simply followed the lead of the American masters. Roogalator prided themselves in escaping from it and in so doing, created the wholly distinctive blueprint for what would become the Britfunk explosion of the early '80s.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ddc7dbfc2c00d7bd460f50cb08b4bc07e92e978","amp;dn":"Roogalator+-+Cincinnati+Fatback","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ddc7dbfc2c00d7bd460f50cb08b4bc07e92e978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,220,125,191,194,192,13,123,212,96,245,12,176,139,75,192,126,146,233,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
