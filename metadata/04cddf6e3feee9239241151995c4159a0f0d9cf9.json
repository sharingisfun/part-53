It also resulted in some of the highest ratings of Letterman's late-night career.\n\nMadonna's language and behavior ? provocative, seemingly random at times, peppered with four-letter words, full of crude double entendres, and ending with a refusal to leave the set ? caused a public controversy.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission received numerous complaints, echoing Letterman's remarks that &quot;people don't want strong language in their homes on late night&quot;. Both Letterman and Madonna were to later publicly regret the appearance.\n\n\nPicture quality is quite bad, and it's jerky, but you can see and hear everything. Trust me - it's worth the download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cddf6e3feee9239241151995c4159a0f0d9cf9","amp;dn":"The+infamous+1994+Madonna+interview+on+the+Late+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cddf6e3feee9239241151995c4159a0f0d9cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,205,223,110,63,238,233,35,146,65,21,25,149,196,21,154,15,13,156,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
