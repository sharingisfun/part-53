Comments &amp; Suggestions are always welcome !!\n   Releases will be made available on a weekly basis, unless a serious bug\n   is found, or something else important happens that justifies an Update.\n\n   ALWAYS REMEMBER:\n\n   This is software in development - You should regard yourself as a BetaTester!\n   Please read the complete Changelogs to keep yourself informed.\n   Some features might still be in their initial development stages ...\n   You can find some Troubleshooting Tips further down this document.\n   Please read this .nfo - it has some useful information, really ;-)\n   Keep a tried and trusted XBMC Version handy, incase you need to go back !\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   SKINS INCLUDED:\n\n   Original Project Mayhem III Skin from CVS only.\n   It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small &amp; Clean.\n   This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,\n   make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.\n   DonÃ‚Â´t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - YouÃ‚Â´re on your own here !\n\n   The only thing thatÃ‚Â´s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.\n   I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface\n   from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice Ã‚Â´coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.\n   This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.\n\n   You can get more Skins here:\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&amp;cat=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&amp;cat=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   SCRIPTS INCLUDED:\n\n   FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers\n   QuickTimeBrowser [fixed] (Movie Trailers) / SubmenuEditor \n   WebRadio (simpleKML V2) / XBMCLyrics / XBMCScripts\n\n   All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style and appear in the Scripts Submenu.\n   You can change the Submenu appearance with the SubmenuEditor yourself. \n\n   Get more Scripts via the XBMCScripts menu or @ http://www.xbmcscripts.com  \n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   VISUALISATION ADDONS INCLUDED (All Zipped):\n\n   G-Force:  1507 total (including the CVS supplied ones)\n   MilkDrop: 7977 total (including the CVS supplied ones)\n              \n   I slightly modified some settings in /visualisations/milkdrop.xml\n   The Milkdrop Addon Pack with 7977 Presets is the default setting.\n   The original file from CVS has been renamed to milkdrop.xml.CVS\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   ABOUT TRAINERS:\n\n   There are 539 Trainers included to give you a good start.\n   I collected these from the net (including Mikerowesoft Packs 1-3) and deleted\n   all (binary) dupes. I absolutely donÃ‚Â´t know which ones work and which donÃ‚Â´t ! \n   PLEASE do not ask me anything about the included Trainers.\n\n   Trainer files need to be in /system/Trainers - Use the context menu on a Game\n   listed in MY PROGRAMS to refresh the Trainer List or to change Trainer options. \n\n   Get Trainers e.g. @ http://trainers.maxconsole.net (Free Registration required)\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   RELEASE NOTES:\n\n   &quot;Trainer engine updated to v2.2. thanks to team xored!&quot;\n   Hmmm - I think that means that .xbtf Trainers do work now ... ?!\n\n   Had many requests to leave the Trainer Pack in, so they are here to stay ;-)\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   CHANGELOG:\n\n   To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can\n   see whatÃ‚Â´s included here.
