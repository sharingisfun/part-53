It was broadcast only once, during the Cosby Show on 3/2/89.  Subsequently, Madonna released her controversial &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; video, and Pepsi withdrew the ad campaign (though Madonna got to keep the $$$).\n\nThere is a txt file included that provides the full background story.\n\nThis is in mpg2 479x640 format. I transferred it from my original VHS Hi Fi tape recorded off-the-air.\n\nbb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d91c7a0f4de5a1c460e4f82d695023a2ba93e1a4","amp;dn":"Madonna+Banned+Pepsi+Commercial+3-2-89","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d91c7a0f4de5a1c460e4f82d695023a2ba93e1a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,28,122,15,77,229,161,196,96,228,248,45,105,80,35,162,186,147,225,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
