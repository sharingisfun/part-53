Producers Michael Balcon and Ivor Montagu gave Hitchcock carte blanche to do what he wanted with his project. The product was acclaimed around the world, and established a new high in the thriller genre. It was only a preview, however, of the films Hitchcock would make from then on. Released directly after Waltzes from Vienna, The Man Who Knew Too Much was Hitchcock&amp;#039;s comeback to the genre he knew best. Actually, the screenplay had already been prepared when he was asked to take on the directing chore of Waltzes from Vienna in 1933. The Man Who Knew Too Much was in many ways indicative of what we could expect from Hitchcock from then on. It is a small, tightly woven film-only 84 minutes-which includes a generous portion of Hitchcockian humour and a more than adequate amount of suspense. Although he was given only a limited budget, he knew the technical tricks which could camouflage the fact. The gripping Albert Hall sequence in which a diplomat is about to be assassinated was actually shot in the Lime Grove studio. A painting by the academician Fortunino Matania reflected with a mirror into the camera lens served as most of the Albert Hall audience.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.britmovie.co.uk/directors/a_hitchcock/filmography/017.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.britmovie.co.uk/directors/a_hitchcock/filmography/017.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGracias,Thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91dbf55d66f2007fdccd74278d21ae75bf83fb8","amp;dn":"The+Man+Who+Knew+Too+Much+1934","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91dbf55d66f2007fdccd74278d21ae75bf83fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,29,191,85,214,111,32,7,253,204,215,66,120,210,26,231,91,248,63,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
