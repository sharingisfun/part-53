The Star Mountain Dreamers were formed in 2003 by Fred Contreras and Tony Estrada. The addition of Danny Magaya on drums and several personel changes on bass including Rockin' Lloyd Tripp and now Moe Lopez completes the band.\n\nThe music is all hot and spicy Texas rockabilly. If you wanna rock, bop and dig it, this is the platter for you. Great rockabilly rhythms, excellent musicianship and a very specific own sound. You might find that the lyrics are a bit hard to understand on the fast tracks, but the way singer Tony Estrada expresses himself with a huge load of energy is really something else. Although fast and loud, the album was recorded in a very vintage way at the El Paso Texas Mobile Unit of &quot;The Studio That Time Forgot&quot; (San Fransisco, CA).\n\nThe album was officially released at the Green Bay Rockin 50s Fest, 2005. The song &quot;Hound Like Me&quot; was selected &quot;Boppin' Crackshot&quot; of August 2005 by the famous Dutch Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle Magazine &quot;Boppin' Around&quot;.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1.Used To Be My Woman \n2.Hound Like Me\n3.Sippin' Syrup \n4.Where've You Been \n5.Devil Moon\n6.Can't Catch And Handle \n7.Texas Rose\n8.She Drives Me High\n9.You Send Me To Heaven\n10.Where'd You Learn Them Things\n11.Rockin' Bandit\n12.Tu Corazon\n\n\nThe Star Mountain Dreamers are:\nTony Estrada - Vocals\nFred Contreras - Guitar\nMoe Lopez - Upright Bass\nDanny Magaya - Drums\n\nGuest musicians:\nRockin' Lloyd tripp - Bass\nEileen Contreras - Acoustic Guitar\n\nMore about the band: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/starmountaindreamers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/starmountaindreamers/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e31b425787c914c538f08672bf3d7b1353bc47fa","amp;dn":"Greetings+From+El+Paso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e31b425787c914c538f08672bf3d7b1353bc47fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,27,66,87,135,201,20,197,56,240,134,114,191,61,123,19,83,188,71,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
