Although reluctant at first, Don and his FBI agents discover that the student's findings were correct and uncover a dangerous and surprising conspiracy. Meanwhile, Alan prepares for a first date and convinces Don and Terry to join them, hoping they might rekindle their old romance.\n\n\n# NOTE: This episode was previously known as &quot;Bulldogs &amp; Buildings.&quot;; This episode was meant to play 5th, but was pushed up to 4th by CBS.\n# CBS included this disclaimer at the start of the episode: THE FOLLOWING STORY IS FICTIONAL AND DOES NOT DEPICT AN ACTUAL PERSON OR EVENT.\n# Opening Text: 150 Feet, 16 MPH, 04 Seconds To Impact, 1100 College Suicides Per Year.\n# We learn that Don and Terry dated each other earlier in their careers.\n# The entire time we see Alan on his date, we never once SEE his date. This was done because the writers found it would be better if you never saw what Alan's &quot;taste in women&quot; was.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865659d6b34f11be1c2be7e8e9f177e67f02aed6","amp;dn":"numb3rs.s01e04.hdtv.xvid-tcm.%5BBT%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865659d6b34f11be1c2be7e8e9f177e67f02aed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,86,89,214,179,79,17,190,28,43,231,232,233,241,119,230,127,2,174,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
