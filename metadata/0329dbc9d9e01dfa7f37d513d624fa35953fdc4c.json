This album was inspired by Maurice Ravel&amp;#039;s waltzes for the piano, and Lena&amp;#039;s soulful and introspective piano takes quite naturally a prominent role on this material. As on their earlier releases (MT002 &amp; MT004), the fundamental soundworld and atmosphere is that of deep beatless ambient, with deliciously layered sounds and carefully crafted, slowly evolving tonal structures. Then there&amp;#039;s the piano - often close and intimate, dwelling peacefully in subtle and rich ambient harmonies; at times wandering more playfully amidst complex tonal structures; and at other times acting as a source to more electronic and artifical sounds.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s a certain cinematic and dramatic feel already in the music itself, and this sense of drama is accented by subtle lines, sighs and sounds originating from some noble and ambient movies by Wim Wenders (track 1), Ingmar Bergman (tracks 2 &amp; 5), Krzysztof Kieslowski (track 3) and Andrei Tarkovsky (track 4).\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 I used to talk to you all the time (even though I was alone)\t\t  13:34\n02 That fine line from your ear to your chin (is not so obvious anymore)  16:37\n03 And if I have no love (I will be nothing)\t\t\t\t  15:22\n04 As soon as I close my eyes (I can?t recall what my face is like)\t  10:43\n05 On a cold Tuesday morning, April 1823\t\t\t\t  15:04\n\n\ttotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  71:20\n\nMore info: \n\nMusictrade website: http://www.musictrade.info\nMusictrade&amp;#039;s Internet Archive pages: http://www.archive.org/details/mt\n\nPrevious Musictrade releases on Pirate Bay:\n\nMT007 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3459597\nMT006 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3425437\nMT005 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3409502\nMT004 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3405718\nMT003 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3376551\nMT002 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3363887\nMT001 http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3343290\n\nEnjoy,\n\nMusictrade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0329dbc9d9e01dfa7f37d513d624fa35953fdc4c","amp;dn":"Doc%26Lena+S.%3A+Noble%2C+Sentimental+%26+Ambient+Waltzes%5Bambient%2CHVBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0329dbc9d9e01dfa7f37d513d624fa35953fdc4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,41,219,201,217,224,29,250,127,55,213,19,214,36,250,53,149,63,220,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
