Mark Durand&amp;#039;s ground-breaking integrative approach is the most modern, scientifically valid method for studying abnormal psychology. In this Fourth Edition of their proven ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY, Barlow and Durand successfully blend sophisticated research (including new prevention coverage) and an accessible writing style with the most widely recognized method of discussing psychopathology. Going beyond simply describing different schools of thought on psychological disorders, the authors explore the interactions of the various forces that contribute to psychopathology. A conversational writing style, consistent pedagogical elements, integrated case studies (95 percent from authors&amp;#039; own files), video clips of clients (on the free accompanying Abnormal Psychology Live CD-ROM), and additional study tools make this text the most complete learning resource available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49190fbfb9062c7c115b3d5ba41fab9225859ec9","amp;dn":"Abnormal+Psychology+E-book+CloneCDimage.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49190fbfb9062c7c115b3d5ba41fab9225859ec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,25,15,191,185,6,44,124,17,91,61,91,164,31,171,146,37,133,158,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
