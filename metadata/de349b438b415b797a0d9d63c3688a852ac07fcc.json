Because it's a very flexible format with amazingly low overhead and avi must die.\nHow to play this? the matroska codec pack @ http://packs.matroska.org/ or VLC @ http://www.videolan.org\nWhy not AC3? Because I don't have 6 speakers.\nWhy not mp3? Because Ogg Vorbis is higher quality  for less size, aka more bits for the video.\nHow to go through chapters? Not sure on windows, maybe with ZoomPlayer or VLC.\nWhy re-release? Bordom, I love this movie and most 2CD releases didn't do the video quality right because of the AC3 sound which makes video smaller.\nDoes this work on mac? i'm not sure, 90% sure it works with VLC, please tell me if not.\nWhy downsampling the audio? because the human-ear can't notice the difference at that quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de349b438b415b797a0d9d63c3688a852ac07fcc","amp;dn":"The.Matrix.DVDRip.WS.XviD-OneOfOne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de349b438b415b797a0d9d63c3688a852ac07fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,52,155,67,139,65,91,121,122,13,157,99,195,104,138,133,42,192,127,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
