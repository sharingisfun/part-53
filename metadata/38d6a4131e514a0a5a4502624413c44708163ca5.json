NTSC \n\nThe Federation starship USS Voyager, chasing a band of \nMaquis rebels, enters the dangerous space nebula known \nas the Badlands. Both ships are transported by a distant \nspace probe to the Delta Quadrant, 75,000 light-years from \nFederation space. Voyager&amp;#039;s crew and the Maquis form an \nuneasy truce to rescue crewmen of both ships, kidnapped \nby the probe&amp;#039;s builder, the powerful, dying Caretaker. \nThe Maquis ship is destroyed in a battle with the warlike \nKazons. To prevent a Kazon aggression against a helpless \nworld, Voyager destroys the space probe. Without the probe,\nit will take 75 years for Voyager to travel back to \nFederation space. With the differences between them \nrendered meaningless by time and distance, The Federation \nand Maquis crews unite aboard Voyager. Together, \nthey embark on their new mission: to boldly go - home.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38d6a4131e514a0a5a4502624413c44708163ca5","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Voyager+Season+7+Disk+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38d6a4131e514a0a5a4502624413c44708163ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,214,164,19,30,81,74,10,90,69,2,98,68,19,196,71,8,22,60,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
