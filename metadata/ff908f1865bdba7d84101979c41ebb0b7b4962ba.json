If you know either &quot;Selected Scenes from the End of the World&quot; and &quot;Psycho-Magnet&quot; (if you don't, get them!) this interesting compilation of unusually stylish live recordings, acoustic versions of previous album tracks, and other alluring curiosities is an essential companion to London After Midnight's previous releases. &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; is a seductive rival to the best of the usual Noel anthems (this is surely to Sean Brennan's credit) and a personal favorite. Other highlights are &quot;Let Me Break You&quot;, &quot;Demon&quot;, &quot;Untitled&quot; and (unless you are astute enough to keep constant watch over your CD player's track indicator) an unexpectedly festive surprise at the end! This release, &quot;Oddities&quot;, is certainly much, much more than a collection of obscurities: it is a classy release in its own right.\n(Review taken from Amazon.com)\n\n&lt;b&gt;Tracklist&lt;/b&gt;\n01 The Christmas Song\n02 Let Me Break You\n03 Splinter\n04 Your Best Nightmare [Live - Acoustic]\n05 Shatter\n06 Claire's Horrors [Live-Remix]\n07 Atmosphere [live]\n08 A Letter to God [live]\n09 Sacrifice [live]\n10 Sally's Song\n11 Demon\n12 Untitled\n13 Spider and the Fly [Acoustic Tangled Web Mix]\n....\n42 Ice\n\n&lt;b&gt;Rip and Encoding&lt;/b&gt;\nExact Audio Copy Secure Mode\nLAME 3.92 VBR (--alt-preset standard)\nNot my rip.
