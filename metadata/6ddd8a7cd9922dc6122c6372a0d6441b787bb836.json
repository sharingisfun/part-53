It can be used to lookup words from almost any Windows program, showing definitions, synonyms and related words. There are also many proper nouns and usage examples. You can search for words matching a pattern, find and solve anagrams, and optionally search a large number of extra word lists.\n\nUnlike any paper dictionary or thesaurus WordWeb is truly a Word Web - each set of synonyms is linked to other related sets. Lookup &quot;tree&quot;, click on the &quot;Types&quot; tab and you'll have a list of different types of tree. Click on &quot;Part of&quot; and WordWeb will tell you that a tree can be part of a &quot;forest&quot; or &quot;wood&quot;.\n\nUnlike any online dictionary, WordWeb allows you to dynamically filter words to find what you want. For example clicking on a sense number shows only synonyms and related words for that word sense. Clicking on the &quot;Noun&quot; button filters the synonyms to show you only noun senses, and double clicking on any word takes you immediately to its definition. It will also suggest the correct form for many common misspellings.\n\nFeatures\nThe fast easy-to-use program lets you:\nLook up words in almost any program, including MS Word\nEdit and add to the database\nFind words matching a pattern\nSolve and find anagrams\nCopy results to the clipboard\nCross-reference to other installed dictionaries and web search engines\nSearch for words in a large number of optional extra word lists\nAdd your own custom glossaries\nConfigure for American, British, Canadian, Australian or Asian English\nOption to hide (default) or flag vulgar and offensive related words\nNEW: Reverse definition (full text) search\nThe extensive up-to-date dictionary database features:\nDefinitions and synonyms, including many compounds and proper nouns\nWord relations: find antonyms, parts or types, less specific words, etc.\nOver 124 000 synonym sets and 156 000 root words\n70 000+ pronunciations, with pop-up hint pronunciation key\n49 000 usage examples\nView alphabetically nearest words, suggestions for many misspellings\nWordWeb Pro runs under Windows NT/95/98/2000/Me/XP.
