He is a webmaster, guerrilla filmmaker, screenwriter, DJ and in his own words, a &quot;self-facilitating media node&quot;. He is convinced he is the epitome of urban cool and therefore secretly terrified he might not be, which is why he reads Sugar Ape Magazine - his bible of cool. \n\nEpisode 1: Baffled human wreck Dan Ashcroft (columnist on Sugar Ape) watches in horror as his world is over-run with 24 carat berks, led by a strutting, brainless cock-of-the-walk called Nathan Barley, who, distressingly, has designs on Dan's sister Claire. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a781b2e82bbefbf97f3b50f651689443b2bb788","amp;dn":"Nathan.Barley.S0E01.DVDrip.DivX-GRAPESODA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a781b2e82bbefbf97f3b50f651689443b2bb788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,120,27,46,130,187,239,191,151,243,181,15,101,22,137,68,59,43,183,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
