Apparently you either love her or fucking hate her. I personally think she&amp;#039;s great. Her music&amp;#039;s great and 80% innovative in my opinion.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s also the school of thought (by men) that she&amp;#039;s an ugly dog. Well I refute that - you may think she looks fucking wierd (what do you expect from an eskimo) but I personally would do her. LOL - ok fun&amp;#039;s over - i&amp;#039;m kidding. No i&amp;#039;m not - I wouldn&amp;#039;t have a prob. Yes I would - I remember the airport incident - damn she is a bit mental on occasion........but nevertheless..........here&amp;#039;s the music. What the fuck am I talking about........cue music.......... shit&amp;#039;s sake.........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c68fadbe298ac5419a6c5d95afd0e1506f45a6","amp;dn":"Bjork+and+1+track+from+Sugarcubes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c68fadbe298ac5419a6c5d95afd0e1506f45a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,198,143,173,190,41,138,197,65,154,108,93,149,175,208,225,80,111,69,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
