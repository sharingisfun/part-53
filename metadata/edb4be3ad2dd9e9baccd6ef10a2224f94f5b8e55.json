It supports all CD and DVD formats and all common CD and DVD file-systems (= set of files and folders).  Start up IsoBuster, Insert a CD or DVD, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media.  IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present.  This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file-system.  Instead of being limited to one file-system that the OS picks for you, you have access to &quot;the complete picture&quot;.  Access data from older sessions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.\n\nCombine this all-revealing functionality with far better read and recovery mechanisms, scanning for lost files functionality, workarounds for a wide range of drive and software bugs, limitations or shortcomings and you have an enormously powerful data recovery tool.  IsoBuster is must-have-software for every PC user and is deliberately kept low priced to be able to offer a solution for everybody, even if it is much used in the professional optical and data forensics world.\n  \nIsoBuster full feature list:\n\n- Data recovery from all possible CD and DVD formats : \n  CD-i, VCD, SVCD, SACD, CD-ROM, CD-ROM XA, CD-R, CD-RW, CD-MRW, ... \n  DVD-ROM, DVCD, DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+MRW, DVD+R Dual Layer, DVD-R Dual Layer, DVD+RW Dual Layer, DVD+VR, DVD+VRW, DVD-VR, DVD-VM, ... \n- All device access, media access, data gathering and interpretation is done exclusively by the software.  It does not rely on Windows to provide or interpret the data and so can work completely independent from Windows' limitations. \n- Better Error handling and several retry-mechanisms to aid you in getting the data anyway. \n- The use of both generic and alternative ways to get to the data, get the best out of your CD/DVD-ROM drive. \n- The use of primary and secondary file-systems to get to the data and/or make use of file system data that might be ignored or ?forgotten? by popular OS.
