Miller, PhD, was the star science witness in the recent Dover ?Panda Trial? in Pennsylvania where Judge John E Jones found ?intelligent design? to be a religious view, not science. He is the author of a bestselling high school biology textbook that was subject to the Cobb County, GA disclaimer sticker that warned students that evolution was ?a theory, not a fact.? The stickers were removed by court order in 2005. Miller is also author of the bestseller Finding Darwin?s God.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b685e1f8175c1f5ce9ff309c3b15154e144a286","amp;dn":"Kenneth+Miller+-+The+Collapse+of+Intelligent+Design.wmv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b685e1f8175c1f5ce9ff309c3b15154e144a286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,104,94,31,129,117,193,245,206,159,243,9,195,177,81,84,225,68,162,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
