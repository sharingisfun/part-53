Miller (LET TRUTH BE THE BIAS; \nTHE PROMISED LAND) unveils the worldwide threat to medical freedom of choice \nin WE BECOME SILENT: The Last Days of Health Freedom.' \n\nWE BECOME SILENT details the ongoing attempts by multinational pharmaceutical \ninterests, giant food companies, and government agencies to limit the public's\naccess to herbs, vitamins and other therapies. The film highlights the U.S. \ngovernment's complicity in suppressing the truth about the effectiveness of \nalternative/complementary medicines, and outlines the international plan to \neliminate freedom of choice in healthcare through the work of the Codex \nAlimentarius Commission. \n\n\nNarrated by Dame Judi Dench, the noted UK actress who has won multiple Golden \nGlobe awards and dozens of other honors throughout her prestigious career, WE \nBECOME SILENT is a powerful statement about the dominance of multinational \ncorporations over personal freedoms. The film describes the ominous \nbureaucratic shadow being cast by Codex, in concert with the World Trade \nOrganization and others - and the challenges consumers face in trying to repel \nthese monoliths from their daily lives. \n\nWE BECOME SILENT features the only known video from inside a Codex meeting, \nexclusive interviews with delegates to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration officials, two U.S. Congressmen, actor Mel Gibson,\nand consumer activists from throughout the world.\n\nWritten and Produced by Kevin P. Miller\nNarrated by Dame Judi Dench\nAssociate Producer: Charles L. Gilchrist\nOriginal Music Composed and Performed by Richard C.
