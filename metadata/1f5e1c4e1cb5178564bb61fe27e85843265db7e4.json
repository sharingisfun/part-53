The band, comprised of frontman Lajon Witherspoon,   |\n|  John Connolly (guitar), Clint Lowery (guitar), Vince Hornsby (bass), and  |\n|  Morgan Rose (drums) first appeared in 1995 as Crawlspace, releasing the   |\n|  single &quot;My Ruin&quot; on the Mortal Kombat: More Kombat recording. Shortly     |\n|  thereafter the group changed their name to Sevendust and released their   |\n|  self-titled debut in 1997. Two years later, they issued Home and played   |\n|  over 800 shows alongside groups like Creed and a gig at Woodstock '99.    |\n|  Their angst-ridden third album, the aptly-titled Animosity appeared in    |\n|  fall 2001, and Seasons followed in 2003. In late December 2004 word       |\n|  surfaced that Lowery had left the band, and those rumors proved true the  |\n|  following February when Sevendust's announced ex-Snot guitarist Sonny     |\n|  Mayo as Lowery's replacement. (Lowery, a co-founder of Sevendust,         |\n|  eventually surfaced in the hard rock supergroup Dark New Day.) Next,      |\n|  Sevendust's fifth album, appeared in October 2005.                        |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5e1c4e1cb5178564bb61fe27e85843265db7e4","amp;dn":"Sevendust-Next_%28Advance%29-2005-FM+%5BHard+Rock%2FAlternative%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5e1c4e1cb5178564bb61fe27e85843265db7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,94,28,78,28,181,23,133,100,187,97,254,39,232,88,67,38,93,183,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
