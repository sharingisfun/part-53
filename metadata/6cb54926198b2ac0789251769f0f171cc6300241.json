A great stylist as well as ingenious synthesist, Holly forged a sound that combined elements of R&amp;B, country, and pop, but was distinctly his own. To wit: such eternal classics as &quot;That'll Be the Day,&quot; &quot;Not Fade Away,&quot; &quot;Peggy Sue,&quot; &quot;Words of Love,&quot; &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; &quot;Heartbeat,&quot; and &quot;Well...All Right&quot;--all included in this 20-song package. At the time of his tragic death, he was moving in still new directions, hinted here by &quot;Reminiscing&quot; (with King Curtis on sax) and the string-aided &quot;True Love Ways.&quot; --Billy Altman \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cb54926198b2ac0789251769f0f171cc6300241","amp;dn":"Buddy+Holly+-+From+The+Original+Master+Tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cb54926198b2ac0789251769f0f171cc6300241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,181,73,38,25,139,42,192,120,146,81,118,159,15,23,28,198,48,2,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
