(?Still Ill?, The Smith), accompanied\nby the deadpan rejoinder, ?I dunno.? Even then, however, it was clear which had\nthe upper hand in the singer?s case. Morrissey was, and has subsequently proved\nto be, a strictly cerebral soul.\n\nIt is surprising, therefore, to hear him declaim, a short way into this his 8th\nsolo record, ?There are explosive kegs between my legs.. Actually, it isn?t just\nsurprising; it is positively shocking. All that time with so little to report on\nthe old S.E.X. front, and now this!? Of course, with Morrissey, he sings this\nbawdy refrain with all the tenderness he once brought to the lines ?Some girls\nare bigger than others,? which, almost 20 years ago, managed to be\nheartbreakingly profound at the same time as being killingly funny. So it is\nhere.\n\nHow refreshing it is to have Morrissey singing about you-know-what at last! Here\nwe are in an industry named for a sexual metaphor (rock?n?roll), and yet we have\nto wait for Morrissey to get down to the real nitty gritty (to use another one).\nAwash, as we are, with songs about doing it, it is hard to recall another song\nor singer who has dared to talk so baldly about sexual longing. (There may be\nsome hair metal on the subject, but if there is it cannot have the impact of\nthis simple line so sweetly sung).\n\nAnd there?s more. Later in the same song (?Dear God Please Help Me?), we hear,\n?Now I?m spreading your legs, with mine in between.? Again, this is what happens\nbetween consenting adults all the time ? or so they assure me - but have you\never heard anyone else sing about it so, um, graphically? Me either. And, once\nheard, it is so thrillingly frank and open that you wonder why others ever\nbother beating about the bush.\n\nElsewhere, on first single, ?You Have Killed Me? - which despite the spin of the\ntitle is one of the most positive and uplifting things Morrissey has done - we\nlearn, ?I entered nothing, and nothing entered me, ?til you came, with the key.?\nGadzooks! It surely trumps the usual mechanical lyrical demurring about buttons\nbeing pushed, or fires being lit.\n\nRingleader of the Tormentors ? which those who have heard it are identifying as\none of his greatest recording achievements - is a record of a different\ncomplexion than all previous Morrissey records. It seems somehow suffused with a\nnew confidence and, dare one venture, happiness? Time was when we scanned the\nobits for Morrissey?s imminent demise ? he probably did too. Indeed, going back\nto ?Still Ill? and all the way through to 2004?s You Are the Quarry, Morrissey\nresolutely hung around the cemetery gates, it being only a matter of time, and a\nblissful release when it comes.\n\nNow, at the end of ?On the Streets I Ran?, recalling a past of ?turning sickness\ninto popular song,? we find Morrissey saying hang on a minute, I might not be\ndone yet, surely it must be someone else?s turn first?: ?The infirm, the\nnewborn, the stillborn, take people from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, take anyone,\njust spare me!? Could it be Morrissey finally found a reason?\n\nRingleader of the Tormentors is a savagely alive record. Recorded at Forum Music\nVillage in Rome with long-term hero Tony Visconti (who produced favorite records\nfor T-Rex and David Bowie, during their most creative periods of the 60?s and\n70s), the album positively crackles with fire. It is, for instance, a far more\ndirect and rocking record than ?Quarry, which aside from ?Irish Blood, English\nHeart?, was a self-consciously beautiful, and largely symphonic, record.\n\nHere, the music punches its full weight, beginning with the loud and glammy ?I\nWill See You in Far Off Places?. Slightly Bedouin in its complex and heavy\nmusical undertow, the song teeters on the verge of being sonically terrifying,\nand is the first indication that Ringleader of the Tormentors is the most\nmusically disturbing record Morrissey has made since The Smiths second album, \nMeat is Murder. \n\nThis feeling of unease and of Morrissey returning to the bleak environs of his \ngreatest early work occurs again and again throughout the album, whether on the \nscene of domestic hell played out in ?The Father Who Must Be Killed? (clue: \nhe is), or in the queasy children?s choir intoning ?There is no such thing in \nlife as normal.? on sure-fire future single ?The Youngest Was the Most Loved?, \nwhich details the early years of a psychopath. \n\nAnd then, right in the middle, to put the tin-lid on the darkness that lies at \nthe centre of this ?happy? Morrissey record, ?Life is a Pigsty?; seven minutes \nin four blighted movements building towards a final, epic and unforeseen conclusion \nof 11th hour redemption. OK, it?s not that happy, but it sure is both powerful \nand moving. \n\nThroughout the album the lyrics have swapped some of the piss-and-vinegar that \ncharacterized ?Quarry (the lock-jawed pop stars thicker than pig shit, uniformed \ngoons, etc), for a real emotional generosity. ?I Just Want to See the Boy Happy? \ndoes what it says on the tin over a delicious horn-led glam rock racket. ?To Me You \nAre a Work of Art? may contain the classic Morrissey couplet, ?I see the world, \nit makes me puke,? but is essentially a paean to a rare diamond in the soggy mire.\n\nRight at the close we get ?At Last I Am Born?, a self-evident proclamation of the \nchanges that have been wrought throughout this extraordinary album and, presumably, \nMorrissey?s life, set to a melodramatic marching rhythm and Duane Eddy guitar. ?I \nonce thought that I, had numerous reasons to cry, and I did, but I don?t anymore, \nbecause I am born.? and ?I once was a mess of guilt because of the flesh.? It?s a \npersonal and professional triumph, which brings us back to?\n\n?Dear God Please Help Me?. Orchestrated by Ennio Morricone (who has over the years \nmade much of his significant work at Forum Music Village), this beautiful song, which \nfor the most part simply describes walking through Rome with an unfettered heart, \nis almost sanctified in its atmosphere. Yes, the lyrical content is \nfrank-bordering-on-prurient, and yet over its six rousing minutes the song swells \nto almost hymnal proportions, until you feel that, for all his supposed remove from \nthe human race, few people can deliver a universal emotional message with more \npower than Morrissey. \n\nSo, Ringleader of the Tormentors: at least two actual deaths, a fair few metaphorical \nones, the odd petite mort, even, but overall an edifying and uplifting experience. \nHail Morrissey, the new Roman emperor!\n\nHELP SEED!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2f5175d8e04cedb9a0845296b10faaca6b0b02","amp;dn":"Morrissey-Ringleader_Of_The_Tormentors-%28Advance%29-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2f5175d8e04cedb9a0845296b10faaca6b0b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,47,81,117,216,224,76,237,185,160,132,82,150,177,15,170,202,107,11,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
