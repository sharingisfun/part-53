The success of the Project would likely entail reductions in taxation and regulation, reforms at all levels of government to expand individual rights and free markets, and a restoration of constitutional federalism, demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97aaf112b879fb964efe10274854d967ceec98c7","amp;dn":"Free+State+Project+Video+v1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97aaf112b879fb964efe10274854d967ceec98c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,170,241,18,184,121,251,150,78,254,16,39,72,84,217,103,206,236,152,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
