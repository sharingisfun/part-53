With a musical quality sky high above most other bands of the genre the Finnish-Canadian Timo Laine (keyboards) teamed up with drummer John Lowery and guitarist David Stone on this 1976 album. Just to whet your appetite, I can inform you that Stone plays a 360 Systems polyphonic guitar synthesizer. Remember, we&amp;#039;re speaking 1976! (I think Steve Howe used to play one, but I&amp;#039;m not sure)\n\nThis upload is a vinyl rip. The album was re-released as a cd in the US in 2001 or 2002, so it is available, but I don&amp;#039;t know the quality of the commercial cd release. For all I know, it just might be one of those &quot;audio-restored&quot; vinyl rips, but I&amp;#039;m not sure.\n\nIf you like Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Yes, King Crimson, U.K., or ASIA, give this a try. After all, it&amp;#039;s for free.\n\n Track listing: Universe (6:37) / Everytime (4:21) / Fold Back (2:50) / I Won&amp;#039;t Cry (2:55) / Let It Grow (3:56) / Modane Train (4:19) / Times Run Short (2:48) / Days (instrumental) (5:00) / Summer Rain (3:53) / How Do You Stand (Before The Lord) (4:56)\n\nmp3-format VBR\n\nThis upload was requested by rumpole.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e35b099c641e9985b4ce08a523d21cbe94e19e06","amp;dn":"Symphonic+Slam--Symphonic+Slam+%28request+by+rumpole%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e35b099c641e9985b4ce08a523d21cbe94e19e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,91,9,156,100,30,153,133,180,206,8,165,35,210,28,190,148,225,158,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
