The demo will offer both single- and multi-player gameplay giving gamers their first chance to play Empire Earth II against others online.\n\nIn the Empire Earth II Multiplayer Demo, gamers will experience three of the game's fifteen exciting epochs (Renaissance, Imperial, and Enlightenment) as they match wits with others around the globe in epic battles with up to 10 players. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to adapt their tactics to manage changing seasons and inclement weather as they lead the German, American, or Korean civilizations to victory. Three of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nine challenging multiplayer modes -- Conquest, King of the Hill, and Territory Control Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are included.\n\nIn addition, the Empire Earth II Multiplayer Demo includes an updated version of the first, single-player-only demo that was previously released, adding several new features. These new features include the ability to set variables such as: game pace, starting resources, population cap, diplomatic settings, and weather &amp; environment details before the game starts. \n\n---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd09fa8bf226d7fbb00f878f1818fb721db4b026","amp;dn":"Empire+Earth+2+-+Multiplayer+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd09fa8bf226d7fbb00f878f1818fb721db4b026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,9,250,139,242,38,215,251,176,15,135,143,24,24,251,114,29,180,176,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
