Follow the Money  \nFirst aired: 10/26/2005\nWriter: Chris Gerolmo \nDirector: Chris Gerolmo \nStory: Chris Gerolmo, Steven Bochco\nGuest star: John Siciliano (Will Hitchings), Adam Storke (Captain Baron), Ana Ortiz (Anna), Cylk Cozart (Col. Kalins) \n(Season Finale) The squad is assigned to protect a civilian convoy. Lt. Underpants leadership skills take a toll on the squad. Back at home, Bo meets somebody who may be able to help him get back in the Army and Sergio receives surprising news from Anna.\n\n\nWell I kept waiting for someone to up this episode but it never happened. So I found it somewhere else and thought I would help out all that are waiting. This has been a great series and there better be a second season or FX may face a boycott. This is not a LOKI rip but it's just about as good. Hope everyone enjoys this because it is going to be a long wait until next season.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67c84c95ba73a7173f9e6e84f26331dcf961f3ed","amp;dn":"Over.There.S01E13.WS.DSR.xvid-tcm.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67c84c95ba73a7173f9e6e84f26331dcf961f3ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,200,76,149,186,115,167,23,63,158,110,132,242,99,49,220,249,97,243,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
