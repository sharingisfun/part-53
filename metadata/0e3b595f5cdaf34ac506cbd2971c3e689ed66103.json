When repeated with several musicians playing around one key and starting them off at different times, the result was a piece that continuously evolved, sounding like a night drive through a neon city with bright sounds appearing on the horizon, coming closer, then disappearing behind. The original recording in 1978 on ECM records was a major step forward for Reich and legitimized his music beyond the experimentation of such works as &amp;quot;Violin Phase.&amp;quot; Where the phase work felt insular and looped, Music for 18 Musicians stretches as far as the eye can see. The piece was rerecorded in the late '90s, but this original recording is worth checking out, even more now for the historical value.\n\nThis is GREAT!\nalmost to great.\nplz enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3b595f5cdaf34ac506cbd2971c3e689ed66103","amp;dn":"Steve+Reich+-+Music+for+18+Musicians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3b595f5cdaf34ac506cbd2971c3e689ed66103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,59,89,95,92,218,243,74,197,6,203,210,151,28,62,104,158,214,97,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
