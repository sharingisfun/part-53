Patricia Arquette (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stigmata,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flirting with DisasterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) stars as a young wife and mother who, since childhood, has been struggling to make sense of her dreams and visions of dead people.\n\nAllison Dubois (Arquette) is a strong-willed young mother of three, a devoted wife and law student who begins to suspect that she can talk to dead people, see the future in her dreams and read people's thoughts. Fearing for her mental health, she turns for support to her husband Joe (Jake Weber, &amp;quot;U-571&amp;quot;), an aerospace engineer, who slowly comes to believe that what his wife is telling him just might be true. The real challenge is convincing her boss, D.A. Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) -- and the other doubters in the criminal justice system -- that her psychic abilities can give them the upper hand when it comes to solving violent and horrifying crimes whose mysteries often reside with those who live beyond the grave. \n\nwww.nbc.com/Medium/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc195a6197433d01009937bb84f2580ebb6cb3f5","amp;dn":"medium.101.hdtv.repack-lol.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc195a6197433d01009937bb84f2580ebb6cb3f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,25,90,97,151,67,61,1,0,153,55,187,132,242,88,14,187,108,179,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
