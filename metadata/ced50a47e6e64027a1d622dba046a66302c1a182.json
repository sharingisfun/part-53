THE JE NE SAIS QUOI'S sound is a swirl of energetic, eclectic and stripped down garagerock mixed with late 70ies New Wave resulting in a sound that is up to date and fresh. Mix THE MAKE UP, WIRE, THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, GANG OF FOUR and add to it the current Swedis flavor. THE JE NE SAIS QUOI'S music is made up by mid tempo nu wave drums, hypnotic organs, driving bass and melodic yet catchy neurotic guitars and vocals that stick! \n\n\nskitbra live!\n\nwww.cilla.com/tjnsq","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ced50a47e6e64027a1d622dba046a66302c1a182","amp;dn":"The+Je+Ne+Sais+Quoi+-+Secret+Language+EP+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ced50a47e6e64027a1d622dba046a66302c1a182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,213,10,71,230,230,64,39,161,214,34,219,160,70,166,99,2,193,161,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
