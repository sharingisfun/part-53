Don \n    pleads  with  her  to break him out of the hospital in order to bring \n    the  truth  to  the  surface. But the student dismisses his claims as \n    paranoia... until someone begins to follow her every step. Soon Don's \n    delusions become her reality, and she must determine what is real and \n    what  is  merely  the  rambling of a madman. Teetering on the edge of \n    sanity,  she is faced with one last decision - whether or not to take \n    an extraordinary risk that could bring about a spectacular healing in \n    Don's mind... and her own.\n\n\n          Director                   ....
