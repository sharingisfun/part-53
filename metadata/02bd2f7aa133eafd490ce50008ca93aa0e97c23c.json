The film is, therefore, notable because it is one of, if not the very first werewolf film ever made; and as\n werewolf movies now have their own niche within the horror genre, much is owed to this movie. However, despite this; the film itself is somewhat less than \nbrilliant. It&amp;#039;s certainly not bad - but it constantly feels as if more could have been made of it, and because of that it gives off a very unfinished sort of\n feel. At just seventy minutes, the film is very short; which is both a blessing and a curse as, although the film doesn&amp;#039;t go over the top with details; it \nalso doesn&amp;#039;t go very far with any of the elements of the plot. There isn&amp;#039;t a great deal of horror in the movie either; and the only real creepy parts are \nthose when the werewolf is on screen. However, as this movie was made in the thirties; the wolf itself has that &amp;#039;shaven&amp;#039; look, which, like the rest of the \nfilm; comes off as unfinished.\n\nThe plot is very similar to The Wolf Man as it follows a scientist who is bitten by a werewolf while on an expedition somewhere. Of course, that bad fortune \nnow means that our protagonist is a werewolf too, and although there&amp;#039;s no cure for &amp;#039;werewolfism&amp;#039;, there is a prevention, which comes in the form of some \nweird plant that blooms by moonlight. The action basically follows our scientist as he becomes a werewolf by night and tries to solve his problem by day. The\n atmosphere in the movie isn&amp;#039;t bad, but has nothing on the atmosphere of many earlier - and later - classics from the time period. Because of the horrid \nwerewolf effects, it&amp;#039;s hard to take the film seriously and when combined with the lack of sympathy for the lead character; the werewolf plot fails to \ngenerate any real tension or a foreboding feeling. Still, this film does have it&amp;#039;s good points; the twist in the tale is very good, and the plot, although \nnot really well done, does have it&amp;#039;s moments. If you&amp;#039;re a fan of Universal horror or classic horror in general, you&amp;#039;ll probably find something to like \nhere...just don&amp;#039;t go in expecting brilliance, because you wont find it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02bd2f7aa133eafd490ce50008ca93aa0e97c23c","amp;dn":"%28Pirate+bay%29Cycle+Monster+Legacy+-+Werewolf+Of+London+PAL+MULTI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02bd2f7aa133eafd490ce50008ca93aa0e97c23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,189,47,122,161,51,234,253,73,12,229,0,8,202,147,170,14,151,194,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
