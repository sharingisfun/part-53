When you upgrade, any settings that do not match the new\ndefault settings are overwritten. These changes decrease the exposure\nof your servers to attacks that are launched through Web content.\nHowever, users will not be able to view many Web pages correctly when\nusing the default security settings. To allow users to see these Web\npages correctly, you must explicitly grant access. In addition, users\nwill not be able to run executable files from Universal Naming\nConvention (UNC) shared folders until you or the users have added the\nshared computer to the Local intranet security zone in Internet\nExplorer. \n\nFor more information about security settings and how to change them,\nsee relnotes.htm in the Docs folder on the operating system disc.\n\n======================================================================\n3.0 Copyright","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7deb0f780d10f2c7bf27ead27ab5f1708dae3a","amp;dn":"WINDOWS+SERVER+2003+DATA+CENTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7deb0f780d10f2c7bf27ead27ab5f1708dae3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,125,235,15,120,13,16,242,199,191,39,234,210,122,181,241,112,141,174,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
