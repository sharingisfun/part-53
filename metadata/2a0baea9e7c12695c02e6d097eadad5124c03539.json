With a lot of Fuherer imposter's, how would they find the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; Hitler: Simple, he had a beer stein cut on his upper lip delivered during the famous Munich Beer Hall Putsch, and grew his trademark mustache to cover it up. All the boys had to do was keep shaving &amp;quot;Hitlers&amp;quot; until they found the real one with the scar. And how did they learn to speak German??? Simple: (in Ward Bond's words) &amp;quot;...from driving a beer truck in Milwaukee...&amp;quot; To everyone who tells me that &amp;quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&amp;quot; was the worst film ever made, I simply reply: &amp;quot;You haven't seen 'Hitler: Dead or Alive.&amp;quot; Watch it for laughs!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a0baea9e7c12695c02e6d097eadad5124c03539","amp;dn":"Hitler+Dead+Or+Alive+1942+Nick+Grinde+%5BGoettersturm+DivX%5D+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a0baea9e7c12695c02e6d097eadad5124c03539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,11,174,169,231,193,38,149,192,46,109,9,126,173,173,81,36,192,53,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
