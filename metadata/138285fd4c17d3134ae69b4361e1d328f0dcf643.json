Be warned that the video quality is not the same as the DVD rips. That doesn't make them any less funny though :) \nThere is one episode which I was unable to find a good version of, in which a flashback to another episode was censored. The episode the flashback came from is intact however, so with these complementary discs you should not be missing any material. \n\nEpisode list:\n\nDog Trouble\nA Mouse in the House\nThe Truce Hurts\nOld Rockin' Chair Tom\nMouse Cleaning\nThe Little Orphan\nSlicked-up Pup\nPush-Button Kitty\nShutter Bugged Cat (Chuck Jones)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:138285fd4c17d3134ae69b4361e1d328f0dcf643","amp;dn":"Tom+and+Jerry+Uncut+VCD2+of+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"138285fd4c17d3134ae69b4361e1d328f0dcf643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,130,133,253,76,23,211,19,74,230,155,67,97,225,211,40,240,220,246,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
