It was recorded to tape and transfered it to MD and then to my PC some years later. I think the DJ is Strictly Kev.\n\nThe sound has been tweaked and polished to sound better. I think you&amp;#039;ll like it.\n\nAt the end there is a mix of Butterfly by Talvin Singh.\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2788d8ca469fe57bc60d7ad6b4e82e9c2614683","amp;dn":"Solid+Steel+Show+28%2F6%2F1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2788d8ca469fe57bc60d7ad6b4e82e9c2614683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,120,141,140,164,105,254,87,188,96,215,173,107,78,130,233,194,97,70,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
