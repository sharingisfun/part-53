As time altered this piece, the term &quot;to invent&quot; became the main drive.\n\nWalking Summer to Sleep\nA composition dedicated to the season and its changes into Autumn. So if one could take summer like a large, theatrical curtain and draw it across time, or walk it as if it were an infant into its final state of rest, this would be the reason why this piece was created.\n\nEaster Eve\nThis originated with musical phrases that came to me during Easter some years ago. It was difficult completing the whole composition when it relates to such a high-level as resurrection and the night before.\n\nCurio Dance #2\nA slower version of the theme in #1 and a final return to their natural shape and location.\n\nThis Picture Will Never Fade\nComposed to acknowledge the period of time during August &amp;#039;78 to November &amp;#039;88. It was the duration in which Debby and I resided on the West Coast. Beautiful friends, beautiful places, and moments to never forget.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:784ce01451651fe883e1af56ff4c96f7747976a8","amp;dn":"Richard+Burmer+-+Invention+%28New+Age%2C+1992+-+256K%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"784ce01451651fe883e1af56ff4c96f7747976a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,76,224,20,81,101,31,232,131,225,175,86,255,76,150,247,116,121,118,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
