Unfortunately, nothing worked out quite as it was supposed to - years later, Hedwig is leading her rock band on a tour of the U.S., telling her life story through a series of concerts at Bilgewater Inn seafood restaurants. Her tour dates coincide with those of arena-rock star Tommy Gnosis, a wide-eyed boy who once loved Hedwig... but then left with all her songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16a3b3f11db305ec1427da789834408f2da909cf","amp;dn":"Hedwig+And+The+Angry+Inch.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16a3b3f11db305ec1427da789834408f2da909cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,163,179,241,29,179,5,236,20,39,218,120,152,52,64,143,45,169,9,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
