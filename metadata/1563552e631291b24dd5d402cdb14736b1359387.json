This time the boys go off to Europe for the Cannonball Europe Run. The race was the fastest and sickest of all the runs so far. It started in the UK and went on through Spain, France, Africa and back to the UK in only 5 days. They made it alive but some cars were lost during the raging road war, also again we were not taken to jail, but some were not so lucky. The rally was filmed using hi-teck Autoxcam system to better put you right in the driving seat and in the middle of the chaos and fun.
