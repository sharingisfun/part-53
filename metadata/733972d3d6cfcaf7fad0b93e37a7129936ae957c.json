Lily Rothenberg asks Davenport, her former lover, \nto come to Manhattan and help the investigation. Despite Bekker's ruined face \n(courtesy of an enraged Davenport), the killer eludes capture and the bodies keep \npiling up, each with the eyelids cut off so that Bekker could photograph his victims as they died. Rothenberg gives Davenport an additional, undercover assignment--to ferret out the &quot;Robin Hoods,&quot; a clandestine police vigilante group responsible for perhaps three dozen deaths, one of which was that of a fellow cop who might have been onto them. Paired with possible Robin Hood Det. Barbara Fell, Davenport taunts Bekker in the media, hoping to goad him into a mistake, but the grisly murders continue. As the momentum gathers, readers will speed through the surprise twists and confrontations of the last chapters. Although the story never drags and Sandford delivers his usual punch, the devices in his winning formula are becoming familiar.\n          --Publishers Weekly\n\n**********************************************************************\nEnjoy it!
