They emerged in the late 80s, put out a majority of their work in the 90s and finally disbanded in the early 2000s. They managed to score a good amount of fans, especially locally, but for the most part remained on the outskirts of popularity.\n\nThis includes basically anything a person can get related to this band. All of their main albums are here (including a reissue with different tracks). Their EPs are here. I even have included the 4CD DIY Box Set that was sold at their last show; only 200 or so were made and they go for a good amount of money on eBay lately. This boxset includes some of their harder to find releases as well as live cuts, radio appearances and demos. \n\nFor more information on the band, check out www.apocalypsehoboken.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6120afee2d196752492552f79c20b63ba66a41f7","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Hoboken+Discography+%28Chicago+Punk+Rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6120afee2d196752492552f79c20b63ba66a41f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,32,175,238,45,25,103,82,73,37,82,247,156,32,182,59,166,106,65,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
