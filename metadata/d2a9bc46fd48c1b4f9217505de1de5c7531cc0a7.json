After a train ride that sets a record for number of people in an upper berth, they are In Miami. Joe decides to be the man of Sugar Kane's dreams and invites her out to a yacht he doesn't have. But he can use Osgood Fielding's yacht if Jerry -- as Daphne -- will keep Osgood dancing. The pace gets even giddier when the Chicago mob arrives in Miami for a convention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2a9bc46fd48c1b4f9217505de1de5c7531cc0a7","amp;dn":"Some_Like_It_Hot_1959_Xvid_MP3_2CDs_BeefStew_RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2a9bc46fd48c1b4f9217505de1de5c7531cc0a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,169,188,70,253,72,193,180,249,33,117,5,222,29,229,199,83,28,192,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
