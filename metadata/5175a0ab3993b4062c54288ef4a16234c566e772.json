Muffin Man\n\nLive in Miami 16-Oct-1976 except tracks 14 and 16, which are live in New York 31-Oct-1976. The sound quality bites it on the New York tracks, and &quot;Muffin Man&quot; is supposed to be especially abominable. The Miami sound is &quot;quite excellent&quot; on Volume I, but not so good on Volume II. Very silly colour covers with non-1976 photos on the back. Released in 1987 and 1988.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5175a0ab3993b4062c54288ef4a16234c566e772","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Miami+Matinee+LP1+%26+LP2++vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5175a0ab3993b4062c54288ef4a16234c566e772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,117,160,171,57,147,180,6,44,84,40,142,244,161,98,52,197,102,231,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
