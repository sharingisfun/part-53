With catchy reggae rythms(I myself hate reggae, but this is.. irresistable. Must... dance..), some norwegian, some english lyrics, and covers of B&amp;oslash;yen Beng(Hoga Hei) and the least known unknown artist of Norway, Per Bergersen(Ridder Sjansel&amp;oslash;s), this band has got all you could ever want and more.
