VENOM!\n\nThis is from the High-Def source (1920x912), remixed to half resolution (960x456).  Should still be enough for everyone.  Also, I re-encoded it to XVID (2-pass) because, frankly, Sorenson sucks.\n\nIf you really want the HD version of the Spiderman trailer, feel free to download the 124 MB file from Apple.  Have fun trying to share it with anyone, though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2114e7dc521df2a08eaef0046a70e1c5472197d5","amp;dn":"Spider-Man+3+Teaser+Trailer.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2114e7dc521df2a08eaef0046a70e1c5472197d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,20,231,220,82,29,242,160,142,174,240,4,106,112,225,197,71,33,151,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
