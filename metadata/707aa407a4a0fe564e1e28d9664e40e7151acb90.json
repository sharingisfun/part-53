Presto (the Magician) is given a hat of magic spells. Eric (the Cavalier) is given a shield that can deflect any attack against it. Diana (the Acrobat) is given a extendable javelin that allows her to do feats of acrobatics. Shiela (the Thief) is given a cloak that when the hood is pulled up, makes her invisable. And Bobby (the Barbarian) is given a club that can crush anything it is struck against. \n\nThey're all being pursued by the evil Venger, a man who's history is somehow tied with the Dungeon Master. His ultimate goal is to acquire all six magical items the kids possess. He has a sub-servant known as the shadow demon who spies on the kids and gives reports on their goings-on. Venger has a mortal enemy, a five-headed dragon named Tiamat. The kids are constantly looking for a way back to their home, but also go where the Dungeon Master tells them their presence is required.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707aa407a4a0fe564e1e28d9664e40e7151acb90","amp;dn":"Dungeons+%26+Dragons+Season+1-3+%5BComplete%5D+%28DVD-RiP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707aa407a4a0fe564e1e28d9664e40e7151acb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,122,164,7,164,160,254,86,78,30,40,217,102,78,64,231,21,26,203,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
