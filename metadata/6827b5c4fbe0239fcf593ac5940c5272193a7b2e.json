Stationed in the heart of \nWWII's European Theater of Operations, players join the ranks of an elite \nmilitary squad entrenched in battle. \n\nEach team has several &quot;player classes,&quot; that give each squad member a \nunique role. These include scout, infantry, sergeant, machine gunner, \nand more, each with a unique arsenal of historical weaponry \nat their disposal. \n\nMore game information can be found on: \n\nwww.dayofdefeat.com - www.valvesoftware.com - www.steampowered.com \n\nRelease Notes: \n\nThis release is full version, but we couldn't get the cd, because the game \nis getting release on cd in some days,weeks or even months, who knows?... \nSo enjoy it anyway even if it isn't bin/cue/iso/whatever \n\n::::::TO ALL THE NUKERS:::::: \nSOME may contend the fact that this is BETA or PRE-FINAL. \nThis is the version that is released on STEAM AS FINAL. You cannot do any \nbetter than this. The fucked thing with STEAM is they can easily release \nmany patches BUT EXPECT the EMPORiO crew to bring each and every patch \nCRACKED to your doorstep!  \n\nIf you nuke this for no bin/cue GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS. HOW CAN \nthis game be BIN/CUE if there is no official store release, but its still \nfinal. \n\nIf you want to compare this w/ the final just find someone who bought HL2 \n(Game gets unlocked on 26th of September 2005)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6827b5c4fbe0239fcf593ac5940c5272193a7b2e","amp;dn":"Day+Of+Defeat+Source+FINAL+READ+NFO-EMPORiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6827b5c4fbe0239fcf593ac5940c5272193a7b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,39,181,196,251,224,35,159,207,89,58,197,148,12,82,114,25,58,123,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
