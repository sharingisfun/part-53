Valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer and tenor-great Stan Getz (who had played together regularly a decade ago) had a reunion for this date, performing five standards and three Brookmeyer originals. The young rhythm section (pianist Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist Gary Burton, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Elvin Jones) uplifts what would have been a fairly conventional (although high-quality) bop date. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\n\nalbum credits\n    Bob Brookmeyer         Trombone (Valve), Main Performer\n    Gary Burton         Vibraphone\n    Ron Carter         Bass\n    Stan Getz         Sax (Tenor)\n    Herbie Hancock         Piano\n    Elvin Jones         Drums\n\nRelease Date\nMay 25, 1964-May 27, 1964\nLabel\nColumbia\n\nTracks:\n\n01 - Jive Hoot                                                       \n02 - Misty                                                           \n03 - The Wrinkle                                                     \n04 - Bracket                                                         \n05 - Skylark                                                         \n06 - Sometime Ago                                                    \n07 - I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face                               \n08 - Who Cares       \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ff5df1624c6488a87a81b63855958dab685b64","amp;dn":"JAZZ-+Bob+Brookmeyer-+Bob+Brookmeyer+and+Friends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ff5df1624c6488a87a81b63855958dab685b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,255,93,241,98,76,100,136,168,122,129,182,56,85,149,141,171,104,91,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
