I have never been so close to the Vertigo stage (far right side) which was great but there were lots of security people all around me,\none right behind me (you can even hear him on the tape ;-) Especially during the first half of the show when it was not dark yet I had to change my postion a bit sometimes or even bend down in order not to be seen....\n\nGeneral comments\n\nScreamers, karaokers and excessive clappers suck... just like ebay sellers.\n\nU2Seek\n\n\n\n\n\nMin f&amp;ouml;rsta torrent s&amp;aring; hoppas det funkar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4edce0055b59913f02e4d7dd85da7328c44189","amp;dn":"U2.Live.Ullevi.050729.Gothenburg.White+Flags+In+The+Land+Of+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce4edce0055b59913f02e4d7dd85da7328c44189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,78,220,224,5,91,89,145,63,2,228,215,221,133,218,115,40,196,65,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
