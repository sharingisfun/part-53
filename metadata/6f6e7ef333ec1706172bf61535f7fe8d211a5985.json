Its satirical targets range across the whole spectrum of British society, from dysfunctional families to heartless government departments.\n\nThis is a world of mass murderers and divorced dads, of illegal aliens and wannabe terrorists, of perverts, tramps, hookers and liars. Monkey Dust is a show that brings out the loser in everybody. \n\nEpisode 5\nAbdul and Shafiq go to Iraq; the Yuppies move to the country; and the Paedofinder-General gets a job processing family photos in Snippy-Snaps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6e7ef333ec1706172bf61535f7fe8d211a5985","amp;dn":"Monkey+Dust+series+5+episode+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6e7ef333ec1706172bf61535f7fe8d211a5985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,110,126,243,51,236,23,6,23,43,246,21,53,247,254,141,33,26,89,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
