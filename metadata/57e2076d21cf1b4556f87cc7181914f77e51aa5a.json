Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes\nyou get this too).\n\nI noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter\nthan the B&amp;W versions.  In Brats, for example, you&amp;#039;ll see that\nsome small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is\nshorter than the restored B&amp;W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.\nNote that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&amp;W versions,\nalthough this is normal if you&amp;#039;ve ever seen a L&amp;H colourised\nversion before.\n\n\nYou can download all torrents done so far by going to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se.&lt;/a&gt;  They&amp;#039;re having a few issues at the\nmoment, so all back torrents should re-appear soon.\nAny suggestions - please leave in comments.\n\nWARNING:  This was created using the latest version of DVD Rebuilder\n*******   and CCE.
