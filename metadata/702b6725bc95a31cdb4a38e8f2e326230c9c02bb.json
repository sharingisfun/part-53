With his two partners, Max scans the airwaves for new and exciting fare. By mistake, Max and his chief technician Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) record a signal for a show called Videodrome. Max is immediately transfixed by the images of sexual torture that he sees, and wants more. His search for the source of the signal leads him into a world filled with sinister characters and realistic hallucinations (or are they?). Harry plays talk show host Nicki Brand, who falls into Max's kinky world. She's in to the rough stuff, and heads off to Pittsburgh to audition for Videodrome. \n...then things get really freaky!\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086541/\nHoppas att det skall falla er i smaken...
