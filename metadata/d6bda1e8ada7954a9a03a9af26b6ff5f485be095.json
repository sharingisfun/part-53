Unconfident in public, he has never learned how to talk to women, lacking all the social skills we have come to expect from leading characters in romance films. Usually relying on the internet as his social net, he finds himself posting messages to a popular Japanese BBS (bulleton board service chat room), asking for love advice. Much of the dialog from the original BBS posts is preserved in the film (both on-screen and spoken), and much of the supporting cast is composed of those who respond to his internet posts.\n\nI particularly loved the film because it shows one of the most authentic views of Japanese city life of any film I've ever come across. In particular, people who live in big cities like Tokyo spend a great deal of their time on the subway, where this love story begins. Thus, after the main character has posted the story of his train encounter to the BBS, other users begin to call him Densha Otoko (Train Man). Too many recent drama films, particularly from Japan, have become too melodramatic, but Densha Otoko is a beautiful, authentic love story.\n---\n\nhave fun,\ncops","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6bda1e8ada7954a9a03a9af26b6ff5f485be095","amp;dn":"Densha.Otoko.2005.TS.SVCD-iNT.XviD.AC3.2CH.Subs+with+english+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6bda1e8ada7954a9a03a9af26b6ff5f485be095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,189,161,232,173,167,149,74,154,3,169,175,38,182,255,95,72,91,224,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
