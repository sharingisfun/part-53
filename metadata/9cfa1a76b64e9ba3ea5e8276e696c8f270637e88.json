At the same time, the documentary argues that the Bush administration has sold this radical and controversial plan for aggressive American military intervention by deliberately manipulating intelligence, political imagery, and the fears of the American people after 9/11.\n\nNarrated by Julian Bond, Hijacking Catastrophe features interviews with more than twenty prominent political observers, including Pentagon whistleblower Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski, who witnessed first-hand how the Bush administration set up a sophisticated propaganda operation to link the anxieties generated by 9/11 to a pre-existing foreign policy agenda that included a preemptive war on Iraq.\n\nAt its core, the film places the deceptions of the Bush administration within the larger frame of questions seldom posed in the mainstream: What, exactly, is the agenda that drove the administration&amp;#039;s pre-war deceptions? How is 9/11 being used to sell this agenda? And what are the stakes for America, Americans, and the world if this agenda succeeds in being fully implemented during a second Bush term?\n\nName.........: Hijacking.Catastrophe.2004.DVDRip.XviD-LisaB.avi\nFilesize.....: 541 MB (or 554,622 KB or 567,932,928 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:10:38 (127,024 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 872 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 576x336 (1.71:1) [=12:7]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cfa1a76b64e9ba3ea5e8276e696c8f270637e88","amp;dn":"Hijacking+Catastrophe%3A+9%2F11%2C+Fear+%26+the+Selling+of+American+Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cfa1a76b64e9ba3ea5e8276e696c8f270637e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,250,26,118,182,78,155,163,234,94,130,118,230,150,200,242,112,99,126,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
