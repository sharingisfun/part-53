It is a journey through the rise and fall of a futuristic city. I don't know what to call the sound, but I am influnced by mainly post-rock and electronica. I sing on most songs, with mostly improvised lyrics, I'd like to focus on the music. Also, I haven't used a single real instrument on any of the songs. All the music was programmed in Reason. Vocals were added in Garageband.\n\nMore Info: http://kr.5star.se/metropolis/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2245580cac44515b9295f2a7cc674ce6bda4c5f6","amp;dn":"Ossian+Bor%C3%A9n+-+Metropolis+%5B192+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2245580cac44515b9295f2a7cc674ce6bda4c5f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,69,88,12,172,68,81,91,146,149,242,167,204,103,76,230,189,164,197,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
