I'm very annoyed with\nhaving to rip CDs with CloneCD in order to play games without\nputting CDs in my drive, so for Thief Gold and Thief 2, these are\nmy solutions. Rather annoyingly, I had to rip all CDs and install\nby mounting them with Alcohol (drive X:), otherwise the games would\nlook for the original discs in my real DVD drive (drive W:)... So \nyou might have to do the same (unless you know of some trick to\nhave the game look at a mounted drive instead of the real drive). \n\nAnyways, I use Alcohol 1.9.5, and can't tell if it works with\nDaemon Tools or some other program, but I can say for sure it\nworks with Alcohol 1.9.5.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n// DiSNEYLAND :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2121115918403caf6ad8fbe1b4c838484c47bc6","amp;dn":"Thief.Gold.and.Thief.II.Mini.Images-DiSNEYLAND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2121115918403caf6ad8fbe1b4c838484c47bc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,18,17,21,145,132,3,202,246,173,143,190,27,76,131,132,132,196,123,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
