You just feel the song. It comes through you. The good songs do 'cause you can write a commercial song where you have to squeeze it out, but the idea songs just happen. They're just...you're riding along sometime and you get something in your mind, and you write it down and that's an idea.\n\n    Sometimes you get an idea from what somebody said...But you don't write it unless you feel like it...They're personal (songs), but they weren't written during the time they were personal.
