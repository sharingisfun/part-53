It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and even WMV movies, too (without the avifile library).\n\nAnother great feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but you can use GGI, SDL (and this way all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA compatible card, even without X11!) and some low level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and ATI), too! Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. MPlayer supports displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens DVB, DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.\n\nMPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls. European/ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Korean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, SubRip, OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS and our own: MPsub). DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed Captions) are supported as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported Input Formats\n\n(S)VCD (Super Video CD) \nCDRwin's .bin image file \nDVD, including encrypted DVD \nMPEG-1/2 (ES/PS/PES/VOB) \nRIFF AVI file format \nASF/WMV/WMA format \nQT/MOV/MP4 format \nRealAudio/RealVideo format \nOgg/OGM files \nVIVO format \nFLI format \nNuppelVideo format \nyuv4mpeg format \nFILM (.cpk) format \nRoQ format \nPVA format \nMatroska \nNSV - Nullsoft Streaming Video \nstreaming via http, RTP, RTSP, mms, mmst, mpst, sdp \nTV \n\n\nSupported Video and Audio Codecs\n\nmost important video codecs:\nMPEG-1 (VCD) and MPEG-2 (SVCD/DVD/DVB) video \nMPEG-4 in all variants including DivX ;-), OpenDivX (DivX4), DivX 5 (Pro), XviD \nWindows Media Video 7/8 (WMV1/2) \nWindows Media Video 9 (WMV3) (using x86 DLL) \nRealVideo 1.0, 2.0 (G2) \nRealVideo 3.0 (RP8), 4.0 (RP9) (using Real libraries) \nSorenson v1/v3 (SVQ1/SVQ3), Cinepak, RPZA and other QuickTime codecs \nDV video \n3ivx \nIntel Indeo3 (3.1, 3.2) \nIntel Indeo 4.1 and 5.0 (using x86 DLL or XAnim codecs) \nVIVO 1.0, 2.0, I263 and other H.263(+) variants (using x86 DLL) \nMJPEG, AVID, VCR2, ASV2 and other hardware formats \nFLI/FLC \nHuffYUV \nvarious old simple RLE-like formats \n\n\n\nKEYBOARD CONTROL\n\n\ngeneral control\n  &lt;- and -&gt;\n       seek backward/forward 10 seconds\n  up and down\n       seek backward/forward  1 minute\n  pgup and pgdown\n       seek backward/forward 10 minutes\n  &lt; and &gt;\n       backward/forward in playlist\n  HOME and END\n       go  to  nex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3411cb3708e593332ff018b5a786ec1b0126e7","amp;dn":"MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre6.zip%5BWindows+Releases%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3411cb3708e593332ff018b5a786ec1b0126e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,52,17,203,55,8,229,147,51,47,240,24,181,167,134,236,27,1,38,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
