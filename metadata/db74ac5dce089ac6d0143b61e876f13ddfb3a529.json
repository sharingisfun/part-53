Alot of people are having problems uploading the dvdr. So here is a smaller version\n\nPLOT - \n\n'Chance' is a black comedy about how hard it is to find &quot;the one&quot;. Mostly told from the point-of-view of a young, sexually aggressive woman, named Chance, whom according to her: &quot;we're all out there looking for true love&quot;, which turns out to be a very elusive thing indeed, and Chance is no exception. She's desperately on the prowl for a man, but since she's more mouse than cat, she get's herself into scrape after scrape in her screwball pursuit of love. Surrounded by a bevy of adoring but completely wrong-for-her men (and one dead girl from Manchester, England), Chance has to pick her way through her messy life in order to figure out which guy is &quot;it&quot;.\n\nTHIS TORRENT IS FOR YOUR PERSONAL ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSE'S ONLY. NOT FOR YOU TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db74ac5dce089ac6d0143b61e876f13ddfb3a529","amp;dn":"Chance+James+Marsters+DIVX+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db74ac5dce089ac6d0143b61e876f13ddfb3a529","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,116,172,93,206,8,154,198,208,20,59,97,232,118,241,61,223,179,165,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
