Trapped in this useless fragment of a body he can only think; his memories, dreams and a limited perception of his environment are the only things left to him. Though not very well acted or directed this haunting film is striking in its originality and bears a powerful anti-war message.\n\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks? Cool!
