They     \n&amp;amp;#729;&amp;amp;#729;                      would reshape the Future by changing the Past.    \n&amp;amp;#729;&amp;amp;#729;                      The plan required something that felt no pity.\n                        No pain.

The process of\n       updating the ifo seemed OK, but while testing I could\n       not get past chapter 32 (of 33 totals). Anyhow, let's\n       say that the menu was nothing to be sorry for, since\n       it's pretty ugly and it is an 15 loop, very poor\n       indeed. The extras aren't worth mentioning, since\n       there was only a cinematic trailer.\n\n       As for Monophonic Audio, it is the original audio track\n       of the movie so there's nothing wrong about it. A qoute:\n\n       Because the producers wanted to preserve the original sound of\n       the movie, Terminator 1 was released in Dolby Digital 1.0.\n       There were also no subtitles present on this disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015970811608ff625af5803471a0f80810383a0c","amp;dn":"The+Terminator+NTSC+CUSTOM+SLOSUBS-iNNOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015970811608ff625af5803471a0f80810383a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,89,112,129,22,8,255,98,90,245,128,52,113,160,248,8,16,56,58,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
