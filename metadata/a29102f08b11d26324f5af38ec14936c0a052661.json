Disc 3 of Top Gear this season. Burn image to DVD.\nDolby Digital 2.0\n4.03GB\nRun Time 2 Hours\n\nEpisode 5\n\nJeremy drives the Prodrive P2, James May gets a lesson on how to drive fast by Formula One legend Sir Jackie Stewart in a TVR Tuscan and Clarkson uses a Citroen to chase some horses, etc.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nJeremy starts the show this week with three family saloons - but don&amp;#039;t switch off, they&amp;#039;ve got over 700bhp between them. His mission is to find out which beefed-up boring saloon is best - Mondeo ST200, Mazda6 MPS or Vectra VXR.\n\nWe&amp;#039;re all going on a miserable holiday...\nThree men in boat may work but three in a caravan doesn&amp;#039;t. TG is not famed for its love of caravans, but the boys decided if you can&amp;#039;t beat them, join them - at least for a weekend.\n\nDorset was their destination, but with Captain Slow at the wheel things go from bad to worse and then really bad. James has an encounter with a bollard, Richard gets kidnapped and the TG dog chucks up in the van. Oh, and then Jeremy decides to cook...\n\nStar in a reasonably priced car is Hollywood actor Brian Cox - think Troy, Bourne Identity and the original Hannibal Lector).\n\nThe British International Motor Show starts next week at the ExCel exhibition centre (we&amp;#039;ll be there - find out who else is in our preview), but before they started to jam it full of shiny cars it was a big empty space crying out for a TG experiment. Cue the Stig in a F1 car (and the Lacetti for practice)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29102f08b11d26324f5af38ec14936c0a052661","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+Season+8+DVD+Disc+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29102f08b11d26324f5af38ec14936c0a052661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,145,2,240,139,17,210,99,36,245,175,56,236,20,147,108,10,5,38,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
