It has been done with ReJig (demux) and reauthored with IfoEdit. The result is a videofile of 5,2GB and three soundtracks, all english. I have stripped the DD2.0 and the dts5.1 and kept only the DD5.1. The resulting reauthored movie is compressed with DVDShrink 25% (after a Deep Analysis)... and nooo, I have'nt used CCE because I can't handle it and the Intervideo results in block noise (=LEGO, probably due to the origin)... OK\n\nVideo     :   NTSC, compressed 25% with DVDShrink\nAudio     :   English DD5.1\nSubs      :   none\nExtra     :   nope\nMenu      :   uhuh\nFBI-warnings, Walt Disney trailers etc.: zero\n\nDon't bitch me about seeding, DVDShrink, lack of subs\n\nThe quality is the ordinary old fashioned NTSC with grainy low light scenes, but since the movie is a slow one the compression is hardly noticable unless you are a bit dorky like me. It's a goos movie... if you like it, buy it (and upload the PAL-version ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12387f0340539762a4d62a9cd0dcf0d0424b2162","amp;dn":"Rosencrantz+and+Guildenstern+are+Dead%2C+repacked+vob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12387f0340539762a4d62a9cd0dcf0d0424b2162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,56,127,3,64,83,151,98,164,214,42,156,208,220,240,208,66,75,33,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
