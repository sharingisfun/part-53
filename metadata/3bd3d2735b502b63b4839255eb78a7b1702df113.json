That's the reason we are doing what we do.\n  \n If you would like to join us we are currently recruiting the following:\n\n - HDTV/PDTV cappers. You must have a decently fast upload and at least \n   one fast PC.\n - Digital cappers for non-digital source (i.e. DSR) Same requirements apply\n   for upload speed and PC as above.\n\n   We can teach you how to cap if you are a novice,  but you must be willing \n   to cap regularly, really love TV, and be all around a cool person,\n   since we will be spending a lot of time together.  \n   \n - Anything else that is legal that may help us. However - \n   we are not looking for suppliers, site affiliations,or dumps, so \n   please don't bother asking. \n\n   We do not respond with technical questions about our releases or tell you \n   where to get them. \n\n CONTACT: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;325440475b464b1c41535e53561c505d455e72555f535b5e1c515d5f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bd3d2735b502b63b4839255eb78a7b1702df113","amp;dn":"My.Name.Is.Earl.S01E05.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-TCM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bd3d2735b502b63b4839255eb78a7b1702df113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,211,210,115,91,80,43,99,180,131,146,85,235,120,167,177,112,45,241,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
