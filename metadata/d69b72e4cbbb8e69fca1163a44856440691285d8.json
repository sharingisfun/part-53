The fastest, toughest players are victorious and the slow and weak are defeated.  The game combines the lightning-fast gameplay of third-person action games with the cooperative team play and gritty roughness of rugby, offering a unique combat sport experience. \n \nThe object of Deathrow is for you to win matches by whatever means necessary, either by scoring as many points as possible before time runs out, or by severely injuring your opponents and removing them from the field of combat.  As the game begins, two teams of four players square off in a combat arena to compete in an intense, unmediated slugfest to determine the champion.  As you engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat with highly intelligent AI opponents seeking retribution for not only themselves, but also for their fallen teammates, you'll soon understand the sacrifices necessary to become the supreme team of the league.\n\n\n\nFeatures  \n \n Multiplayer support for up to eight players \nHighly detailed characters, modeled using more than 55 bones each for life-like movement, and up to 7000 polygons each for a realistic character shape \nFacial animation capable of blinking and talking, and expressing pain, anger, happiness and other moods \nMore than 15 combat sports arena locations, each with their own unique architecture and gameplay elements \n13 playable teams, each with their own background, special abilities, and motivation for competing \nAutomatic victory if you remove all of your opponent's players from the field of combat \nTeam management component allowing you to customize your own team according to your style of play.
