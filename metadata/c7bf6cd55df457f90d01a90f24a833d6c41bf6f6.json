In Europe, Germany expands and rearms and proceeds to annex several border countries into the Reich. Meanwhile, Italy attempts to establish a Facist Colonial Empire under Mussolini while the Empire of Japan stands ready for a major war with China. Enter the Henry family, headed by career naval officer Victor &quot;Pug&quot; Henry. &quot;Winds of War&quot; thus follows the exploits of Pug and his children, all of which are set against the backdrop of world events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\nPOWERFUL! POWERFUL! POWERFUL! Herman Wouk&amp;#039;s novel is nearly as good adapted to the screen as it was a novel. The mini series was perfectly cast and superbly acted. I&amp;#039;d forgotten how beautiful Polly Bergen and Ali McGraw are in this film! Robert Mitchum&amp;#039;s performance is absolutely flawless. I recall seeing this several years ago and I loved it then. I love it even more on DVD! I am now trying to find the sequel, War and Remembrance. If I recall, it is every bit as good! Back to this one, however. Ali McGraw does a fantastic job as a jewish woman trapped in a Europe dominated by the jew-hating Nazis. She is trapped because of the trepidation of her uncle, who hates to leave his beloved Italy. As a consequence, she ends up stuck as well. There are many complications, not the least of which is that she is married to an American Naval Officer, Byron Henry, superbly played by Jan Michael-Vincent. This is a long one (&gt;15 hours!) but is well worth the time it takes to watch it.\n\nRegion Free  \n\nThis is the final part. ( Continuing with War &amp; Remembrance 1-7 , 8-12 )\n\nAwards: Nominated for 4 Golden Globes. Another 5 wins &amp; 10 nominations\n\nIncl.
