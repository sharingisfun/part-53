For within the dingy corridors of the \nartificial biosphere, the lone survivor of a devastating crash has \nexpertly wormed his way into the lives of the colony&amp;#039;s personnel. \n\nA scientist known as Davros. \n\nSeparated from one another across space and time, the Doctor and Mel\nfind themselves in very different predicaments: Mel has been employed\non Lethe, while the Doctor has been imprisoned aboard an alien spacecraft.\nBoth situations are inexorably linked, however,and at the apex of the two\nsits Davros and the terrifying possibility of a new threat even more \npowerful than the Daleks! \n\nRescuing Mel and stopping Davros should be the DoctorÃ‚Â¹s primary goals, but\ncould it be that this time, Mel does not wish to be rescued? And might\nDavros actually be working on something for the benefit of the civilised galaxies \n\nThis story takes place between &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; and &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c36fe51a817ed396b5f265505a772b205d242d8","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+Juggernauts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c36fe51a817ed396b5f265505a772b205d242d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,54,254,81,168,23,237,57,107,95,38,85,5,167,114,178,5,210,66,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
