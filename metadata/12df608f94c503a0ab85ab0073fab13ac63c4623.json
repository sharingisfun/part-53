The health implications, government policies and push towards globalization are all part of the reason why many people are alarmed by the introduction of genetically altered crops into our food supply.\n\nShot on location in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, THE FUTURE OF FOOD examines the complex web of market and political forces that are changing what we eat as huge multinational corporations seek to control the world&amp;#039;s food system. The film also explores alternatives to large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic and sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the farm crisis today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12df608f94c503a0ab85ab0073fab13ac63c4623","amp;dn":"The+Future+of+Food","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12df608f94c503a0ab85ab0073fab13ac63c4623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,223,96,143,148,197,3,160,171,133,171,0,115,250,177,58,198,60,70,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
