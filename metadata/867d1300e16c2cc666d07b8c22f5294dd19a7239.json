Besides developing a love for classical music, Franke also experimented in eclectic music with the electronic/new age band, Tangerine Dream. Between 1970 and 1988. Tangerine Dream enjoyed a very successful run, releasing over 36 albums and several motion picture soundtrack recordings.\n\nAfter leaving Tangerine Dream in 1988 to explore new creative concepts and directions, Franke founded the Berlin Symphonic Orchestra in an effort to combine his signature &quot;musical expressions&quot; with an equal balance of orechestal, ethnic and electronic music. During this period, Franke released his first solo album, Pacific Coast Highway, followed by The London Concert in 1993. His passionate interest in nature and healing inspired Franke to release Enchanting Nature in 1996, which was met with worlwide acclaim and impressive sales. The response to Enchanting Nature paved the way for his biggest-selling solo effort to date, The Celestine Prophecy- A Musical Voyage. This majestic, yet sincere, musical companion to Kames Redfield&amp;#039;s national best-selling book, The Celestine Prophecy, is considered by many to be one of the most creative new age albums ever produced in the genre. This was followed by a unique collaboration, Transformation Of Mind, which paired several portic readings by Deepak Chopra, along with nine delicate compositions by Franke.\n\nWhile being recognized as a major force in new age music, Franke has also garnered a tremendous amount of attention for several film and television scores including Babylon 5 and Tarzan And The Lost City. Franke is currently busy at work with his many film and television projects as well as sequels to some of his most successful new age albums&quot;\n--------------------------------------\n======================================================================\n.NFO file created with NFO Sighting V1.0.469 on 1/21/2006 at 11:05 PM\n\nFor more information on NFO Sighting\nvisit http://www.rogerhelliwell.com/comp/NFOFrameset.html\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867d1300e16c2cc666d07b8c22f5294dd19a7239","amp;dn":"Christopher+Franke+-+Epic+%28New+Age+EM+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867d1300e16c2cc666d07b8c22f5294dd19a7239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,125,19,0,225,108,44,198,102,208,123,140,34,245,41,77,209,154,114,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
