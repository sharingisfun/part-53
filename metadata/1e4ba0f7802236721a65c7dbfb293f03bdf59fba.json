They moved to San Francisco in October 1966 and recorded a number of songs at Golden State Recorders. Their only LP was recorded in late 1967 and released on MTA Records label in early 1968. The group disbanded sometime in 1968.&amp;quot;-DD\n\nThis is one of my all time favourite albums. Many know this band from the much-comped track Susie's Gone, but that is really the one 'experimental' track on the album.\nI consider this album to be the epitome of 'bright &amp;amp; breezy' psych-pop. It has weird tinny keyboards, wonderful but somehow off-kilter vocal harmonies.\nAll the songs are very short, many less than two minutes. Stand-out tracks for me are Riding Home Again and By My Side.\nBonus tracks included.\nEnjoy!\nbrainticket","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e4ba0f7802236721a65c7dbfb293f03bdf59fba","amp;dn":"Afterglow-s%2Ft+%28Superb+USA+Psychedelia+1968%29%28256%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e4ba0f7802236721a65c7dbfb293f03bdf59fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,75,160,247,128,34,54,114,26,101,199,219,251,41,63,3,189,245,159,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
