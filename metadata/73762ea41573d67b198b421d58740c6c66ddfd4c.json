On 27 February Virgin Records will release Placebo?s new single, ?Because I Want You?(release date subject to change).\n\n?Because I Want You? will be the first single from the band?s fifth as-yet-untitled album. It?s an urgent, impassioned plea to unrequited love; three-and-a-half minutes of joyous pop, reminiscent of the band?s early work and a strong indication of what to expect from the new album. \n\nAs mentioned, the as yet untitled album, will be released on 13th March on Virgin Records. More details to follow shortly.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73762ea41573d67b198b421d58740c6c66ddfd4c","amp;dn":"Placebo+-+Because+I+Want+You+%28+2006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73762ea41573d67b198b421d58740c6c66ddfd4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,118,46,164,21,115,214,123,25,139,66,29,88,116,12,108,102,221,253,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
