Forget flying a P-51 over nazi germany. In this game you go down and dirty to survive furios dogfigths over the middle east, either as a US Navy Pilot relying on his skill and his Skyhawk or as a Mercanary, figthing for glory in a hired F-100 Super Sabre. \n\nYou cant thrust your missiles. You can only trust your instinct and your training. \nWill you choose a older plane to have guns when you missiles fail you or will you rely on missiles to destroy your foe and avoid a direct dogfight? Its up to you. \nBut thoose MiG-17 Frescos are coming closer. \n\n\nUploaded by clan_viking for Thurvang.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fee88461ae057ce5963443fdfec179d31733c2b","amp;dn":"Strike+Figthers%3A+Project+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fee88461ae057ce5963443fdfec179d31733c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,238,136,70,26,224,87,206,89,99,68,63,223,236,23,157,49,115,60,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
