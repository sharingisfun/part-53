The Story Of The Clash which was a MTV UK 120 minutes special has a great interview with Joe on a canal boat plus pots of complete songs. The wired interview from channel 4 in the UK is good and looks like it was done at the same time. The Ex-S programme was only shown in Scotland and features Richard jobson and Joe Strummer and is hilarious, watch out for my favourite line ever &amp;quot;What do you think of that then Jobson&amp;quot; The way Joe says it is hilarious, all these are quite rare but an essential part of any punks history lessons, enjoy!\n\nThe Story Of The Clash MTV UK 120 minutes Special1988 SVCD 60 Minutes\nJoe Strummer Wired Interview CH4 UK TV 20th May 1988 SVCD 11 Minutes\nEx-S Joe Strummer &amp;amp; Richard Jobson BBC TV 14th December 1993 SVCD 30 Minutes                                     \n                      \nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy.
