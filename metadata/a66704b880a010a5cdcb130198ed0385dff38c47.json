The Joe Strummer Rockpalast 1999 secon part contains full versions of Brand New Cadillac, I Fought The Law, Tommy Gun, Bankrobber and an Interview. You can use TMPGEnc to cut the incomplete version of Brand New Cadillac from my first post and join them together and put the full show on DVD if you want. To fill up the space on the CD i have included the special that was broadcast by the Punk Rock Show a canadian show which has been getting shown on the Extreme channel here in the UK. Its a really nice heartfelt tribute to a truly inspiring man who's down to earth generosity and passion inspired more people to form bands than any other human being, enjoy!\n\n\nJoe Strummer Punk Show Special Issue 1 Vol.2 2003 SVCD 24 Minutes\nJoe Strummer Rockpalast(part two) 21st August 1999 SVCD 24 Minutes\n\n\nThe Punk Rock Movie-Classic Documentary 1978 SVCD 80 Minutes\n\nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players.
