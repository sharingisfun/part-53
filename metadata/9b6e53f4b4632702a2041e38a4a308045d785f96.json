While there, Chicken encounters Lok Wing Ho, the younger brother of Gee (Gigi Leung), a girl he almost married seven years earlier. Flashbacks show how the two met as children and became close friends, living across the hall from one another in a crowded tenement. However, as the years pass, the gap between them widens, with Gee thinking seriously about school and the future, while Chicken and his slacker buddies join up with Hung Hing boss Brother Bee (Ng Chi Hung). The fact that Chicken has become a triad is particularly upsetting to Gee and she goes out of her way to avoid him. The love-struck Chicken takes this rejection quite hard but is shocked to discover soon afterwards that Gee is desperately trying to earn money by working as a hostess in one of Hung Hing's night clubs. The girl's ailing mother (Shaw Brothers veteran Lily Li) needs $10,000 to pay for an operation and she makes Chicken swear that he will take care of Gee and her little brother, should anything happen. The woman dies two months later, and Chicken promises to accompany the two to Macau, but he is detained by gang business and they end-up leaving without him. After killing a Fukienese boss, Chicken cools his heels in a small fishing community on Lamma Island and begins a relationship with local girl Chu (Chan Pak Yue).
