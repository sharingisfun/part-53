No idea when it was made, or who it was\nreleased to, or indeed anything else about it for that matter. The only\nsignificant marking is on the cardboard case, which reads: &quot;SEGA MEGA-CD\n- GAMES WITHOUT FRONTIERS&quot; - a scan of this is included with the torrent.\nOne of the only things I do know about it is that Games Without Frontiers\nis a song by Peter Gabriel. His CD &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot; also makes an\nappearance near the end of the video (I can&amp;#039;t belive I just wrote that).\n\nSome more detailed information:\n\nEncoder: VirtualDub v1.6.15 (filters used: DotCrawl Comb filter, Smart\nDeinterlace v2.8 beta 1, internal VDub cropping function)\nVideo Codec: x264 r534, 2-pass mode\nBitrate: around 1.3 Mbps\nResolution: 704 x 568\nFrames per second: 25.000\nVideo Format: PAL\nAudio Codec: LAME v3.97 b1\nBitrate: 192kbps, CBR stereo\nSource of content: A plain old VHS tape\nSubtitles: No\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e903988f31c9d3479ba410091767324a0d6bb70a","amp;dn":"Sega+Mega-CD+Promo+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e903988f31c9d3479ba410091767324a0d6bb70a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,3,152,143,49,201,211,71,155,164,16,9,23,103,50,74,13,107,183,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
