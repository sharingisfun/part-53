It can be found at MiniNova. \n\nI have borrowed this file, re-encoded it into DivX, and added Schaft's 'Broken English', the soundtrack used when the trailer was shown at various anime conventions. I'm pretty proud of the result. The video is nowhere near as glossy as the original Matroska file, but it runs on everything I've thrown it at. \n\nVideo size: 640 x 464\nAspect ratio: 1.38:1\nAudio Codec: ffdshow Audio Decoder\nVideo Codec: ffdshow MPEG-4 Video Decoder\n\nIf I can trust my software, this result should be compatible with DivX Home Theater. \n\nMuch thanks to VeryFluffy for providing me with the raw material to create this; I could not have done it without your dedicated work. Hopefuly you will not see what I've done to your work and decide to hunt me down like the scurvy dog I am. :)\n\nOh, and Ha-Chan...? Bite me. :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:969917923541cedff6b238fe92a8d92f7a73310a","amp;dn":"Hellsing+OVA+Trailer--DivX%2C+Broken+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"969917923541cedff6b238fe92a8d92f7a73310a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,153,23,146,53,65,206,223,246,178,56,254,146,168,217,47,122,115,49,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
