He rides on his SUPERSONIC COMPUTERIZED SPEEDCYCLE. The evil Omega Force, led by its chief, Prosser, pursues Rider until Rider breaks through the &quot;Wall of Illusion&quot;. Here Rider meets a group of mystics called the Enlightened and a young woman named Nastassia. The mystics convince Rider to help them rescue Nasrassia's father from the clutches of Prosser's Omega Force.\n\n\tNastassia leads The Rider through caverns of frightening deformed mutants and then through underground passages which lead to Omega Headquarters. Breathtaking chases and narrow escapes make this film an unforgettable futuristic thriller.&quot;\n\n-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-\n\tTo list the inaccuracies and just pure bullshit of that description would take a text file larger than the movie itself. But a fuck-load of people get shot, blown up and killed.\n\n-Notes-\nHoly Fuck. This may possibly be the last movie I ever release. Why? I don't think I will ever be able to find a movie as fucking great as this one. Seriously, this may possibly be the greatest 'bad' movie I have ever seen. Of the 87 minutes, I believe there are about 10 where people aren't being killed. The acting is horrible, the sound fx and music are horrendously hilarious, the music and costumes SCREAM 1980s, there is no plot, no development, no attempt at logic, no attempt at explanations or apologies, just explosions, fire, guns,  helicopters, car chases, blood, more explosions,futuristic weaponry, woman punching, karate fights, explosions, MegaWeapons, scrolling intro-text, narration, explosions and a few more explosions as well. If you have ever enjoyed a bad movie, or any action movie, you MUST download this. Oh yeah, and the actor is the lovechild of George Michael and Russell Crowe.\n\nThings that ripped off this movie:\nKITT from Knight Rider (Shut up, I don't care that it came first)\nDr. Evil from Austin Powers (Yep, it was Prosser, not Dr. No)\nDOOM's FPS scenes (Not taken from the video game, but from this movie)\n\nBy reading the IMDB boards I discovered that MST3K actually used this for an episode once. I would love to see that, so someone should definately upload that episode if they have it, it may be the one way this movie could be more entertaining.\n\n\nFUN FACT!\nDirector/writer 'David Worth' says that he was hired, shipped to Italy, and told to begin work on the film.... before he ever had a script. He was reportedly shown a poster for the film and told to make a film that would go with it.\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Warrior.of.the.Lost.World.VHSCapture.LRH.avi\nFilesize.....: 692 MB (or 709,140 KB or 726,159,360 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:27:08 (156,685 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1071 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-2 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 32 kb/s, monophonic CBR \nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\n\n*QUESTIONS*\nWhy is the resolution so small?\n...That's as high as my capture card will go.
