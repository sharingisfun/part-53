If we count in the extra track &amp;#039;Shiver&amp;#039;, this means thirteen outstanding songs with a catchy temperament, without ever losing depth. Most of the songs are up to mid paced stunners with strong refrains you will recognize after a few spins. De single &amp;#039;Again It&amp;#039;s Over&amp;#039; is a nice example of that. A video clip was shot for this track and it is the featuring song on a six-track MCD with three non album tracks. Some of the songs are introduced by magnificent piano sounds, but another salient feature of the album are the heavy riffs. On the other hand, the band once again rules with some heartbreaking, sensitive ballads. &amp;#039;Short Glance&amp;#039; and the with strings relished &amp;#039;Sad Theme For A Marriage&amp;#039; are dreamy, contemplative songs that are fine to listen to, but the extremely marvellous &amp;#039;My Mescaline&amp;#039; is my personal favourite. This album sounds as if Sisters Of Mercy suddenly decided to cover Type O&amp;#039;Negative, Him, Sentenced or The 69 Eyes, they say in the biography and I cannot think of a better summary. Top class of a band who always had a warm place in my heart, since the very beginning.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9152088f72949ee96182a6ca5cd8ea1e57fcb5e2","amp;dn":"Lacrimas+Profundere+-+Filthy+Notes+for+Frozen+Hearts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9152088f72949ee96182a6ca5cd8ea1e57fcb5e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,82,8,143,114,148,158,233,97,130,166,202,92,216,234,30,87,252,181,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
