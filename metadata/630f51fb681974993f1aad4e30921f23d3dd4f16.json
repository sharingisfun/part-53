This will take a while to seed, but if you're a Live Aid fan, its worth it.\n\nYou'll find in these set of four disks (on seven hours) &amp;quot;nearly&amp;quot; all the\nmissing bits that were not included in the official Live Aid box set.\n\nYou'll find below the complete list of what's in and what's not.\n\nAs for the disks :\n\nThey are PAL but should be readable on any computer in the world. People\nliving in an NTSC country should check their equipment (DVD player / TV set)\nfor compatibility with PAL signals.\n\nThe disks are region free. They were copied onto DVD using a Pionneer DVR\n720H with a compression factor giving two hours of recording per disk.\n\nWe have not made menus nor chapters on these disks (but you can skip by ten minutes steps). \n\nThis compilation was made from a large variety of sources, from the BBC\n(pal) feed the German (pal) feed, MTV (ntsc) and ABC (ntsc) on either VHS or Betamax tapes.\n\nThe quality varies from very good to &amp;quot;watchable&amp;quot; but this is all what we had\nat the time of creation. The sound is mono and sometime even only left chanel. It's quality varies from good to &amp;quot;low and hissy&amp;quot;.\n\nOf course, this product isn't official. It was only made in order to fill\nthe gaps in the official Live Aid box. The digital transfert has been made in order to store this historical performance. The makers of these DVDs would like to point out that there has been non intent to profit in any way from this recording. On this purpose many messages were included to urge\npeople not to sell this product and make donations to the Live Aid / Band Aid trusts by the usual means.\n\nFurthermore, the makers of this compilation urge everyone not to sell or\nredistribute these DVDs for a monetary profit.\n\nRemember Live Aid was not about music. It was about people dying.\nTo make a donation visit [ http://www.liveaiddvd.net ]\n\nWe would like you to help this set being distributed via any way.\nVisit [ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/liveaid ] for discussing and trading\nLive Aid music.
