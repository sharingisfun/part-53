This is cartoon music for the post-postmodern era.\n----\nHello,\n\nMy name is Zenpho, I've been making electronic music for years.\n\nI love sitting down in my studio and experimenting with chaining processing hardware and running recursive software processes, to munge and distort audio making new sounds.\n\nAround 3 years ago (that makes it 2002) I put together this album as a result of such experiments.\nIts not all ambient washes of noise, there are melodies, beats and grooves too. Dip in, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nAll of the mp3s in this .torrent are availiable to BUY from iTunes, or from CDBaby.com\n\nSearch for Zenpho on the iTunes store,\nor go to http://www.cdbaby.com/zenpho\n\n- I hope you enjoy listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c18f111977c74a20d9274eaeb9dcc306b1ba62","amp;dn":"%28cdbaby.com%29+Zenpho+-+NEW+ELECTRONICA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c18f111977c74a20d9274eaeb9dcc306b1ba62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,193,143,17,25,119,199,74,32,217,39,78,174,185,220,195,6,177,186,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
