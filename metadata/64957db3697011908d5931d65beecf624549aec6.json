A common question asked is if GK is a solo effort, or a band. The answer is that it&amp;#039;s a bit of both. While Sean Malone is the primary composer, each musician involved is free to contribute in his or her own way. Suggestions are made regarding certain key elements, creating a framework within which each performer adds his or her own interpretation. As with the dÃƒÂ©but CD, Gordian Knot benefits its own genre by not being a part of it; in other words, the core of the music is the structure and pitches, presenting itself in several textural guises all the while leaving room for each performer to show his musicianship and voice.\n\nEmergent features the following musicians:\n\nBill Bruford (Yes, King Crimson, EarthWorks)\nSteve Hackett (Genesis, GTR)\nJason GÃƒÂ¶bel (Cynic)\nSean Reinert (Cynic)\nJim Matheos (Fates Warning) \nPaul Masvidal (Cynic - featured on &quot;Muttersprache&quot;)\n\nEmergent is an extension of the compositional style presented in the first Gordian Knot release, with an emphasis on large-scale compositions (Some Brighter Thing, Singing Deep Mountain), thematic content between and within the pieces, and dense, contrapuntal layers.\n\n1.
