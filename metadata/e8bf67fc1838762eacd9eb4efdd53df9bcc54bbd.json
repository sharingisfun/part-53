Only 100 of these mini-discs were ever issued. The hordes of Zim fans who missed out were left soaking their pillows with bitter tears. It also made the ZiMPhony disc a sort of Rolex watch--a pearl of great price, possessed by the priveleged few. \n\nYeah well, enter the pirate. :) \n\nThis broadcast includes much more music than the ZiM promo disc--5 hours and 325 files. The drawback to this recording is, it isn't what you'd call 'audiophile' quality--all the songs are 64 kbps. \n\nHOWEVER-- \n1) It never was audiophile quality, as I understand it--it was low-bandwidth streaming audio formulated for broadcast over the Internet. \n2) It still sounds damn good--just turn the bass up a bit, and\n3) It has songs called &quot;Toilet Horrors&quot; and &quot;Lice-A-Roni&quot;. GOOD GRIEF, MAN!  \n\nThe broadcast groups the music of ZiM into blocks according to episode, contains a few &quot;Station break&quot; tracks, and a 22-minute interview with Kevin Manthei. The torrent also has 2 .JPEG scans of the mini-disc insert and the disc itself. \n\nHere's the tracklist:\n\nTHE NIGHTMARE BEGINS\nIn the Beginning* (1:55)\nSmackdown Source (1:00)\nZim is Late (0:08)\nZim Enters Conventia (0:25)\nTo Earth (0:25)\nEntering Earth's Atmosphere* (0:26)\nZim's House (0:54)\nOur First Chase (1:13)\nDib Doesn't Quit (0:32)\nLeader Report (0:34)\n\nBESTEST FRIEND\nDark Daydream (0:48)\nBestest Friends* (0:48)\nBike Stalker (0:20)\nParty Favors (0:15)\nCarnival Nightmares* (0:43)\nThey're Coming (0:35)\nNew Eyes (1:12)\n\nDARK HARVEST\nHappy Day* (0:10)\nFirst Donor (1:28)\nThe Cooing (0:34)\nHarvester Zim* (0:33)\nHorror Chase* (2:13)\nHeadlines (0:18)\n\nPARENT TEACHER NIGHT\nSchool's Out (0:32)\nMakeup Lady (1:07)\nTV Lair (0:18)\nSpine Break SRC (0:18)\nFamily Programming SRC (0:28)\nParents Arrive (0:14)\nParents Crack* (1:48)\n\nWALK OF DOOM\nTo the City (2:55)\nI'm Blind!
