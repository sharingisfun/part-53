It gives you a beautifully simple step-based sequencer that lets you create loops using built in soft synths, or any samples you choose to load. Loved by Pro&amp;#039;s but so easy to use you&amp;#039;ll be creating your own tracks straight away.\n\nFruityLoops has always been a popular choice with desktop musicians; its intuitive interface and unrivalled parameter tweaking have earned it the reputation of being one of the best loop creation tools available.\n\nFruity Loops is, simply, a great fun program. It&amp;#039;s easy-to-use,you&amp;#039;ll be making music within a few minutes of installing the software, and it can easily be used alongside other music production tools.\n\nFruity Loops is ideal for trance, techno or house production, and you could probably turn out a fair Garage tune on it, too. It aims to emulate the classic, old-school synths that producers of these kinds of music love.\n\nWith Fruity Loops you compose your own loops using drum machines and synthesisers - and it really doesn&amp;#039;t take too much time to get under way. There are loads of helpful things like chord generators which help you get on with programming the music without the need to know all the theory.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;ve never played with a synth before, it can be intimidating with all the talk of oscillators and voltage-controlled filters. By far the best way to find out what all the bits do is to turn the knobs and listen to the results - and Fruity Loops&amp;#039; synths are great for that! So as well as making great music, you can learn as you go. You can also import and tweak samples in WAV format, so you can drop breaks and licks from other sources into your tunes.\n\nWe think FruityLoops is amazing value for what it does and it&amp;#039;ll be a while before you need anything else....\n\nFL Studio (formerly Fruityloops) is the most complete virtual studio currently available. You will be creating wav, mp3 or midi songs or loops only minutes after launching it.\n\nFL Studio (formerly Fruityloops) is a full-featured sequencer perfectly suited for creation of complex songs and realistic drum loops, with 32 bit internal mixing and advanced MIDI support. The resulting song or loop can be exported to a WAV/MP3 file and all MIDI events can be exported to a standard MIDI file.\n\nFL Studio is a fun product but still helps you to create great sounding music. Use it on its own or as a fantastic complementary product for Cakewalk&amp;#039;s SONAR, Home Studio, Music Creator, etc, Syntrillium&amp;#039;s Cool Edit Pro 2, Adobe Audition, Steinberg Cubase, Cubasis, etc, ACID etc\n\nFL Studio can play any sample file (wav), generator (FL Studio soft- synth), VSTi &amp; DXi) or midi instrument you feed it.\n\nFL Studio comes in 3 flavours: Fruityloops Edition, Producer Edition and XXL Edition. The Producer Edition includes everything found in the Fruityloops edition, plus audio recording and editing capabilities, XXL Edition includes FL Studio Producer edition, DirectWave Sampler, Sytrus Synthesizer, SimSynth Live,DrumSynth Live,Fruity SoundFont Player, Fruity DX-10, VideoPlayer and ~2.4 Gb DVD Sample Collection.

Then you can add a wide range of effects to your instruments (reverb, phaser, flanger etc.) and route the resulting mixer tracks in any way you like to create complex mixing chains with ease.\n\nKey New Features in FL Studio 6\n\nEnhanced mixer\nBasic PDC support\nMultiple MIDI input\nSupport for MIDI hold &amp; sostenuto\nDirectWave: full blown, multi layer/multi velocity sampler- MTC Wrapper plug-in (only XXL)\nNew Fruity Multiband Compressor plug-in (3 band)\nNew Sytrus 2 included in XXL - check more at www.sytrus.com (only XXL)\nNew EQUO automatable equalizer plugin\nNew Fruity Reeverb 2 plugin\nNew Fruity Squeeze plugin\nNew Chrome plug-in (visual effects)\nNew &amp;#039;one-click recording&amp;#039; option\nFPC2 plug-in (8 banks of 16 pads, ADSR envelopes, FX, kit &amp; loop library\nFruity Browser &quot;Search&quot; capabilities\n\nMain Features of Fruityloops software (all editions):\n\nInternal 32 bit floating point mixing, up to 96kHz stereo.\n\nSupports DirectSound and ASIO enabled sound cards for audio output.\n\nAbility to function as a VSTi, DXi and a ReWire client.\n\nAbility to host ReWire clients itself.\n\nRealtime linear interpolation &amp; sophisticated interpolation algorithms at rendering time.\n\nOpen architecture allowing third-party instruments (enhanced proprietary FL instruments standard, VSTi and DXi2) and effects (enhanced proprietary FL effects standard, VST, VST2 and DirectX).\n\nEffects: A full set of high-precision mastering and special effects filters: reverb, compressor, procedural equalizer, distortion, phaser, flanger, bass boost, delay line and other.\n\nAdvanced sequencing methods allowing quick entering of realistic drum loops (step sequencing grid) and composing complex instrumentals (advanced piano roll, arpeggiator, keyboard tracking, real-time gate).\n\nUnique note properties morphing ability (pitch, cutoff, resonance, panning).\n\nAdvanced mixer: 68 mixer tracks (64 insert and 4 send tracks) supporting up to 8 filters each; mixer tracks rerouting for creating of complex mixer chains; track recording with ASIO input support (for recording MIDI, vocals etc.); integrated procedural equalizer, volume and panning for each mixer track.\n\nIntegrated instruments: Sampler, TS404 (the popular bassline engine), 3xOSC (subsynth), Plucked!
