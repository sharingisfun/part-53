Director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi speak of their film and short shots from the film are included.\n\nI know a lot of people want full dvds in one torrent but, really, this featurette would add another 500 MB to an already large torrent, why I have decided to upload the featurette separately as a good quality 75 MB DivX/avi file. This way, you can have it all. Also, this featurette can serve as a preview for those of you not sure if you'll want the film.\n\nYou can, of course, convert it to dvd files using a program like WinAVI Converter and compile it with the main feature. But the film will be one of my largest files so far (6500 MB); so combining them will reduce image quality further, in the case you will want to burn Lianna onto a single 4.7 GB dvdr. \n\nRunning time: 9 minutes.\nFormat: Home Theatre-certified DivX avi.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:692eaa32bbb4f52ab04fb23d4dc2de3b62fcd1c8","amp;dn":"Featurette+on+%5C%27Lianna%5C%27+%28w.+director+Sayles+and+producer+Renzi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"692eaa32bbb4f52ab04fb23d4dc2de3b62fcd1c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,46,170,50,187,180,245,42,176,79,178,61,77,194,222,59,98,252,209,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
