But if you're ready to go thru 2 X 700 Mo on edk, go for the DVD on bittorrent...\n\nAnd Boon, don't call me names again amigo.;-)\n\nThe Matrix Dezionized\na special edition combining Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions to one complete movie.\nunauthorized fanmade edition by the CBB group.\n\nEverything that has a beginning... may not have a disappointing end.\nBut the Matrix Trilogy had a very disappointing end.\nReloaded was nothing compared to The Matrix and Revolutions even nothing compared to Reloaded...\n\nPathetic.\n\nThat is why we made this edition. We did watch the movies over and over, sensing there was quality in them, but so many things were distracting, did not make much sense, were just boring to watch.\n\nThen Boon came up with the idea to leave out Zion at all, to never have Morpheus speech, nor the great battle, not the dance scene, not the prime minister and especially no Commander Locke. We thought about it a lot and we came to the result, he was right. Zion had to be left out of the sequels to get a better movie and it would be possible to do that without destroying the plot, cause all major and important actions happen to be at other locations than Zion. We also shortened lots of other scenes we did not like or thought to be not fitting, e.G. the dream sequence beginning, where Trinity falls out of the window. Although this scene was great action, it just was not thrilling and as it is repeated later on, we just deletetd it (in fact we put this scene to the point, when it actually happened and deleted the shortened version there). Of course we thougt about plenty other scenes to leave out, e.G. the indian family in the beginning of Revolutions, but we decided it was good to have that for mood and plot. All in all it took us several months to think about which scenes to keep and which one to cut.\n\nCodec Video : RV9 EHQ 2pass\nCodec Audio : Real Audio\nResolution : 624X256\nEnglish subs in the MKV\n2H50m","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:466ba84aab82707a75f914f36ec04ea719022f39","amp;dn":"Matrix.DeZIONized.2005.CBB.FZB.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"466ba84aab82707a75f914f36ec04ea719022f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,107,168,74,171,130,112,122,117,249,20,243,110,192,78,167,25,2,47,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
