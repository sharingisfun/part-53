We become observers of the events that happen throughout the day, as the film is filled with long tracking shots of students going out of and into classes, the cafeteria, the gym, or the library. The characters in the film are mostly played by non-actors, and most of the film is improvised.\n\nRuntime: 81 min \nCountry: USA \nLanguage: English / German \nColor: Color [Pal] DVD9\nSound Mix: Dolby Digital \n\nNordic Retail.\n\nHere is a reseed of Elephant. Cheers for the crew of TPB for the short down time after the police raid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5c2b6f9419e30cda4a91fb78334ee1294aa024","amp;dn":"Elephant+%5BDVD9%5D+Nordic+Retail.+%5BReseed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5c2b6f9419e30cda4a91fb78334ee1294aa024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,92,43,111,148,25,227,12,218,74,145,251,120,51,78,225,41,74,160,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
