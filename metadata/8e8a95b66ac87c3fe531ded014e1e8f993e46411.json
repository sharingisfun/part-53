But a couple of weeks ago, speedi from the afterdawn  Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  forums found a nice way to tweak the laser so it reads almost any burnedÃ‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  media including some DVD+Rs. We recommend doing this laser tweak if you Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  have any problems reading your DVDs. We are no laser experts, in fact   Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  we think it would be more appropriate to just lower the value of the    Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  variable resistor instead of setting it to an absoulte given value,     Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  but lots of people including us have been using this laser tweek for a  Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  couple of weeks without any problem reported so far.

For now, the ISO of the file needs to   Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³    be patched with 0rbital's great ViperTemporaryAudioFix 1.1+. If the   Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³    ISO is not patched you'll have noise instead of music.

But    Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  on REAL HARDWARE, each file/fst has to be aligned on a 4-byte boundary! Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  Else nothing will work.

But note that Garbage is NOT NEEDED by the GC. The      Ã‚Â³\n Ã‚Â³  files must be correctly aligned that's it.
