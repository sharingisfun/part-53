For some reason, Rastaman Vibration proved to be Marley&amp;#039;s breakthrough album in America. Not that the album was any better than the ones that had come before it; in fact, Live!, its immediate predecessor, is an excellent introduction to Marley&amp;#039;s magic. This album found Marley and his Wailers experimenting a bit more with both the music (listen to the synthesizer on &quot;Who the Cap Fit&quot;) and the polyrhythms. &quot;War,&quot; &quot;Rat Race,&quot; &quot;Positive Vibrations,&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Johnny Was&quot; (which is, essentially, pure soul music) all became Marley staples. Ironically, a year late, punk bands would be making efforts to help this music break through even more to rock audiences. --Bill Holdship","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4852434a85a809608528e318ff53e33b2ee19ce6","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+Rastaman+Vibration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4852434a85a809608528e318ff53e33b2ee19ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,82,67,74,133,168,9,96,133,40,227,24,255,83,227,59,46,225,156,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
