As with the spaghetti westerns, the lone gunman enters into a town where the people have lost the will to fight back and proceeds to kill off the bad guys single-handedly. But once he is out-numbered totally and wounded, some do find the capability to fight back. Chief of those who try to aid him is a widow (Stacie Foster) with a young son. Brion James plays the general in charge of the marauders.\n\n-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-\n\tMan, that first line got it exactly.\n\n-Notes-\nHow I'd like to think they came up with the idea:\n&quot;Noticing the similarities in style, tone and story between many of the post-apocalyptic scenarios and the classic American Western, that itself took much from the Japanese Samurai film, we set out to create a true exploration of the degradation of society after a nuclear holocaust back into a more natural state of survival.&quot;\n\nHow I'm sure it really happened:\n&quot;The West was pretty awesome&quot;\n&quot;Yeah, but it'd be awesomer if it had cars and machine guns.&quot;\n\n75% High Plains Drifter\n25% Mad Max 2: Road Warrior\n\nThis is a really fun movie. There's nothing about it that's atrocious, I don't think it'd make a good MST3K, its just not that bad. It is however, extremely entertaining. Its got some really great fights, some awesome gunplay/showdowns, car chases and a badass lead with some pretty great lines. Its basically High Plains Drifter with machine guns, explosions and car chases added to it. Starring a guy who looks like that Gigilo from Duece Bigelo. Don't miss it!\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Steel.Frontier.VHSCapture.LRH.avi\nFilesize.....: 696 MB (or 713,590 KB or 730,716,160 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:41:33 (182,594 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 883 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 69 kb/s (34/ch, stereo) VBR \nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\n\n*QUESTIONS*\nWhy is the resolution so small?\n...That's as high as my capture card will go.
