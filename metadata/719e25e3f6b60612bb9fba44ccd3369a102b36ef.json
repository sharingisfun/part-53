Without him, the battle must continue, and the fight must go on.\n\nHere are the arnold blockbuster fantastic highlights :\n\n- Arnold DIES\n\n- Sully Kills himself on a reverse upsidedown gravity cliff\n\n- Biggs (That black guy) fights himself to death\n\n- Alyssa milano (jenny) addresses some real disturbing issues not considered by the movie&amp;#039;s original author(s)\n\n- The *alternate* ending!\n\nIf you have trouble viewing the video, you might want to install the DiVX Codec.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719e25e3f6b60612bb9fba44ccd3369a102b36ef","amp;dn":"Commando+%281987%29+RE-EDITED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719e25e3f6b60612bb9fba44ccd3369a102b36ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,158,37,227,246,182,6,18,187,159,186,68,204,211,54,154,16,43,54,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
