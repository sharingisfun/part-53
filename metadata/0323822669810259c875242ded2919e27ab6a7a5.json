It is a world-wide bestseller with 36 million copies in print (as of August 2005) and has been translated into 44 languages. Combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy theory genres, the novel has helped generate popular interest in certain theories concerning the Holy Grail legend and the role of Mary Magdalene in the history of Christianity ? theories that Christians typically consider heretical and historians consider factually inaccurate. It is a sequel to Brown's 2000 novel Angels and Demons, again featuring the character Robert Langdon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0323822669810259c875242ded2919e27ab6a7a5","amp;dn":"Dan+Brown+-+The+Da+Vinci+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0323822669810259c875242ded2919e27ab6a7a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,35,130,38,105,129,2,89,200,117,36,45,237,41,25,226,122,182,167,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
