It seems that the sounds of Hell-Mart taken out of context have a profound effect. It is a torture tape, especially so for the one million-plus Hell-Mart employees. Comments are appreciated. How does this recording make YOU feel?...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029b371bd7a342841aeb80c4a80e972fe07d388a","amp;dn":"The+Sounds+of+Hell-Mart+%28WalMart%29+EVIL%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029b371bd7a342841aeb80c4a80e972fe07d388a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,155,55,27,215,163,66,132,26,235,128,196,168,14,151,47,224,125,56,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
