Now that conjures up some kinda imagery doesn't it? 14 new tracks embracing the very ethics of dub's experimentation but with enough bravado to inject a creative and distinctive twist! Dirty, heavyweight bowl tingling dub yes! But combined with enough JA Reggae to African Roots to USA Funk/Jazz melodies and an execution of 'touch' at the studio mixing desk that defies that throw away 'knock it together in five minutes' attitude employed by so many of today's 'wannabe' dub meisters which has held back dub's real appreciation by wider audiences for far too long!\n\nYou see, 'dub' or the 'dub version' is the deconstruction of a track that already exists, or in the case of exponents like the Dub Funk Association, tracks that should have existed!!! Cool throbbing basslines alone make not a good dub track my friends! We need the melodies! So enjoy this, the fourth instalment of Tanty Records' next documented chapter of dub's developments and achievements, featuring the familiar with the new found dub producers/artists from across the globe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c7ed0bc8b4112e5a8c290cc26809b15cba0e02c","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Roots+of+Dub+Funk+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c7ed0bc8b4112e5a8c290cc26809b15cba0e02c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,126,208,188,139,65,18,229,168,194,144,204,38,128,155,21,203,160,224,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
