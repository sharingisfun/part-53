(&quot;If you can Dream&quot; for Ella, &quot;Between the Lines&quot; for Gabrielle and &quot;Better Together&quot; for Ari), as well as the songs each one was based around. It's not a bad cd, and I can see that it could easily appeal to the tween set. These files weren't checked for errors, but the cd they were encoded from didn't have enough scratches to mess up the quality, from what I can tell. If you find any major errors (tracks skipping, sound fading, stuff like that), let me know, and I'll see what I can do.\nTrack List:\n01- Be a Star\n02- Beauty and the Beast\n03- We got the Beat\n04- If you can Dream (Ella's theme)\n05- Better Together (Ari's theme)\n06- A dream is a wish your heart makes\n07- Walking on sunshine\n08- Part of your world\n09- Between the Lines (Gabrielle's theme)\n10- Do what we wanna do\n11- Some day my prince will come\n12- Give a little love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad44f430265245820154b4913aabb53f964aa6e","amp;dn":"Radio+Disney+Pop+Dreamers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad44f430265245820154b4913aabb53f964aa6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,212,79,67,2,101,36,88,32,21,75,73,19,170,187,83,249,100,170,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
