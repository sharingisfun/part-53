Just extract and run install.bat. Loadlin will then erase DOS from memory and overwrite it with the linux kernel, booting linux without even rebooting.\n\nThis can't be run from windows, or XP's rescue-CD-DOS-prompt. If using XP you can start DOS with a bootdisk. If linux.tar.gz is extracted to a NTFS-partition you'll have to use some ntfs4dos prog for reading.\n\nDuring the installation you'll have to start a shell and mount the partition which linuz.tar.gz has been extracted to, to be able to install the drivers and base-system from it. The rest will be downloaded from the net.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d084d4a71f86f0185de5ed8e5a36378c30f35d0","amp;dn":"Debian+GNU%2FLinux+3+0+%5C%22Woody%5C%22+install-from-DOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d084d4a71f86f0185de5ed8e5a36378c30f35d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,8,77,74,113,248,111,1,133,222,94,216,229,163,99,120,195,15,53,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
