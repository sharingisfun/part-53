But when Ben scores a beautiful new girlfriend named Lindsey (Drew Barrymore), suddenly anything is possible. That is, until baseball season begins, and Lindsey finds herself competing with an entire baseball team - the Boston Red Sox - for her boyfriend's heart and soul. Will Ben's obsession with the Sox put his passion for Lindsey on the bench, or will love win out? And can his team finally break the curse of the Bambino? Hilarious and wildly entertaining, Fever Pitch scores a home run!     \n \n \n \n \n Product Information  \n \n \n   Features: \n Commentary by Peter and Bobby Farrelly\n13 Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Peter and Bobby Farrelly\nGag Reel \nBreak the Curse and Love Triangle Featurettes\nFox Movie Channel Presents Making a Scene\nTrailer &amp; More!  \n\nVideo:  Widescreen 2.35:1 Color (Anamorphic) \n \n\nAudio:  ENGLISH: Dolby Digital 5.1 [CC] \nSPANISH: Dolby Digital Surround \nFRENCH: Dolby Digital Surround \n \n\nSubtitles:  English, Spanish  \n    Includes:\n Audio Commentary\n \nRelease Date: 9-13-2005\n\nPackaging: Keep Case\nDisc: SS-DL\n\nItem Code: 2229841\nUPC Code: 024543198413\n \n \n \n \n \n Film Information  \n \n \n   Actors:\n ?
