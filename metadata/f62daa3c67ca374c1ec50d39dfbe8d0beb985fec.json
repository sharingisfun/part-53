But anyway, Jaco Pastorius talks about his playing and music with bass player Jerry Jemmott. Later on, he jams with John Scofield on guitar and Kenwood Dennard on drums, followed by some Jaco solo piano.\n\nThere are some references to excercises throughout the video. I anybody would upload these, I would be delighted :-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f62daa3c67ca374c1ec50d39dfbe8d0beb985fec","amp;dn":"Jaco+Pastorius+-+Modern+Electric+Bass+-+Dvdrip+-+Xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f62daa3c67ca374c1ec50d39dfbe8d0beb985fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,45,170,60,103,202,55,76,30,197,13,57,223,190,141,11,235,152,95,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
