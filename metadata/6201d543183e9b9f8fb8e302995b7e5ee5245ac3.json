It doesn't come naturally to him to tread carefully to avoid accusations of police racism there and at Denton Police Station. Then one of his informants from the estate, Natalie Bell, is murdered, and he feels guilty for possibly compromising her. Tanner uncovers an interesting aspect of the information she had passed to Frost over the years. As Frost's team close in on the robbery suspects, the woman's child is abducted, and Frost sets off in single pursuit, resulting in a confrontation in an abandoned warehouse, while Tanner interviews and arrests the killer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6201d543183e9b9f8fb8e302995b7e5ee5245ac3","amp;dn":"A+Touch+Of+Frost+-+2x01-++A+Minority+Of+One+avi%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6201d543183e9b9f8fb8e302995b7e5ee5245ac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,1,213,67,24,62,155,159,143,184,227,2,153,91,126,94,229,36,90,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
