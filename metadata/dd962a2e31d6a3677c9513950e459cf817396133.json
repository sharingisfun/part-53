So, I guess this is your only way to get it working.\n\nThis package is untested. I&amp;#039;ve seen it work (looked good) but haven&amp;#039;t flown the aircraft as it does not fall in my sphere of interest.\n\nPlease feel free to report any problems. Though I won&amp;#039;t promise I&amp;#039;ll do anything to resolve your problems.\n\nCheers,\nFlightMaster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd962a2e31d6a3677c9513950e459cf817396133","amp;dn":"FS2004+-Flight1+Super80+%5BRe-Seed+on+Request%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd962a2e31d6a3677c9513950e459cf817396133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,150,42,46,49,214,163,103,124,149,19,149,14,69,156,248,23,57,97,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
