A war in the Middle East has made gas prices skyrocket, and investment banker Tom Hanson (Christian Slater, VERY BAD THINGS) is approached to investigate a deal to take over a huge Russian oil company. As it becomes increasingly clear that there are some shady dealings going on--though obfuscation on exactly what may stem from writer and former Goldman-Sachs employee Ruth Epstein's familiarity with overly-technical matters--Tom succeeds in hiring a new recruit, the ecologically-minded Abby (Selma Blair, HELLBOY). Love blossoms, but is interrupted by the appearance of femme fatale Anna (Angie Harmon, LAW &amp; ORDER), who seduces him. Ultimately, however, Tom begins to realize both the implications of the deal with which he is enmeshed, as well as the true intentions of his new paramour.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30a0b579abf0fcfd201151e78d0e170bd89bd651","amp;dn":"The+Deal+-+2005+-+DVDRip+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30a0b579abf0fcfd201151e78d0e170bd89bd651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,160,181,121,171,240,252,253,32,17,81,231,141,14,23,11,216,155,214,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
