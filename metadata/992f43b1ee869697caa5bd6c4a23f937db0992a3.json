Born and raised in the Icelandic\nwoods with his parents, he early found his interest in\ncreating music. When he only was five years old he got his\nfirst piano, and when he was nine he began to take lessons \nin playing organ in the church. Actually he played the organ\nduring every sunday for three years, and he has in several\ninterviews claimed that he ranks himself as a master on the\norgan, an instrument that often is used in his songs.\nStyvfittur Gerhardsdottirs first album - simply called\n&quot;Tree Of Life&quot; - got released on the 17th of June\n(Iceland&amp;#039;s National Day) in the year of 2005. An album\ncontaining everything from soft and emotional piano to\nheavy-beated organic power.\n                    \nTRACKLISTING:                               \n                                                       \n01  VattnajÃƒÂ¶kull                                05:06 min\n02  Bring The Banjo, Granny\t\t\t03:32 min\n03  Morning\t\t\t\t\t04:53 min\n04  Rest Is Best\t\t\t\t03:18 min\n05  Beats Of The Church\t\t\t\t02:05 min\n06  Organs Lovin&amp;#039;\t\t\t\t03:23 min\n07  We Need Ray\t\t\t\t\t02:41 min\n08  Geysir Funk\t\t\t\t\t02:17 min\n09  Icelandur Finale                       \t03:22 min\t\n---------------------------------------------------------\nTotal time\t\t\t\t\t30:39 min\nTotal size\t\t\t\t\t42.10 MB\n                                      \n        MBR is currently not looking for anything in  \n         particular, but will keep up the work to\n\t bring you the hottest and newest things.\n \t))0))0))0)) MAGICALBOOSTARIPPER ((0((0((0((","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992f43b1ee869697caa5bd6c4a23f937db0992a3","amp;dn":"Styvfittur_Gerhardsdottir_Tree_Of_Life%5BElectronic%5D%5B2005%5D-MBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992f43b1ee869697caa5bd6c4a23f937db0992a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,47,67,177,238,134,150,151,202,165,189,108,74,35,249,55,219,9,146,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
