Of course, those can't be entirely erased, especially since the hits &amp;quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;We Got the Beat&amp;quot; form the core of the collection, but the song selection on the 14-track compilation leans a little too heavily on latter-day material and lesser songs, including an extraneous, previously unreleased cover of &amp;quot;Cool Jerk&amp;quot; that was added as bait for collectors. As a brief overview, Greatest is adequate, since it does contain all the hit singles, but it's also misleading, since it doesn't capture the group's punky spirit. Nevertheless, it's a cheaper, more manageable introduction than the double-disc set Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's, even though serious fans should choose that collection instead.\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23d262e5db3d8cbe8af79d8600571be2e34a6091","amp;dn":"Go-+Go%5C%27s-Greatest+hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23d262e5db3d8cbe8af79d8600571be2e34a6091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,210,98,229,219,61,140,190,138,247,157,134,0,87,27,226,227,74,96,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
