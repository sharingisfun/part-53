Frost is called out when a dead body is discovered in a flooded public conveniences, which he recognises as a long-time drug addict, Ben Cornish. He and Dr McKenzie assume the death was accidental and drug-related, but the post-mortem surprisingly shows that he was beaten and kicked to death. The trail to the culprit involves raking up a local doctor's past, tracing the people with whom Cornish was sharing a squat, and dealing with his family, who have mixed emotions about his death. Frost also decides to confront an aspect of his own past, and tries to renew his friendship with Eileen Grant, the woman with whom he was having an affair before his wife became ill.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f6a4b56033a9ad3f4d064640acff87937bf021","amp;dn":"A+Touch+Of+Frost+-+2x03+-+Nothing+To+Hide+avi%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f6a4b56033a9ad3f4d064640acff87937bf021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,246,164,181,96,51,169,173,63,77,6,70,64,172,255,135,147,123,240,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
