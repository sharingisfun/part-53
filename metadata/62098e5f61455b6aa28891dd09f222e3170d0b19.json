It contains experimental code\n            that may be unsuitable for production environments.\n            If you are dependent upon FlashFXP in a production\n            environment, but still want to test the beta, we recommend\n            you install to a new directory.\n\n            Updates since FlashFXP v3.2.0.1080\n\n            New Features\n\n            - The graph font can now be changed seperately from the\n              application font.\n            - Global &quot;Bind Socket to IP&quot; setting.\n            - Per-Site &quot;Bind Socket to IP&quot; setting.\n            - Multi-language support. See the translation forums\n              (http://www.inicom.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=160)\n              for more information.\n            - Added new status msg &quot;Listening on PORT: X, Waiting for\n              connection.&quot; to help troubleshoot PORT mode connections.\n            - If Passive mode fails two times in a row, FlashFXP will\n              switch to PORT mode or vis versa.\n            - If the connection is lost to the ftp site you can\n              continue to browse cached folders and queue files,\n              if a task is performed that requires a connection\n              flashfxp will reconnect back to the ftp site and then\n              perform that task.\n\t\n\t          Changes\n\t\n            - Syncronized Browsing. When browsing remotely the local sync\n              now occurs after the change dir, rather than after the list\n              complete.\n            - Rename will now cancel out if the folder/file name only\n              contains spaces.\n\n            Fixes\n\n            - When selecting files in the local browsing the selection size\n              isn't updated probably due to a syntax error.\n            - If FlashFXP was locked with a password and on transfer\n              complete triggers it was unable to close properly.\n            - If the connection is lost during a delete operation and\n              the user clicks yes to the a reconnect prompt, after connecting\n              FlashFXP sometimes ended up in the wrong folder.\n            - Once the connection retry count was reached the 'Go' and 'stop\n              after current transfer' buttons states weren't updated properly.\n            - If you connect to a site and while that connection is still\n              being attempted click 'go' the connection attempt isn't\n              properly reset prior to connecting to the site in the queue.\n            - Other minor fixes.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62098e5f61455b6aa28891dd09f222e3170d0b19","amp;dn":"FlashFXP.v3.3.3.1100.Multilanguage.READ.NFO-BiTYE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62098e5f61455b6aa28891dd09f222e3170d0b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,9,142,95,97,69,91,106,162,136,145,221,9,242,34,227,23,13,11,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
