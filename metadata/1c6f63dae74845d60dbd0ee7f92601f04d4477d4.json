This time, the concept behind the instrumental music is one that draws comparisons between the extraterrestrial and the divine, finding archetypical parity in these cosmic mysteries in such pieces as &amp;#039;Saucers over Nazca, &amp;#039; &amp;#039;Spirits of the Rainforest,&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Virtual Gods&amp;#039;. Although the main temperament is still ambient soundscapes, the use of recognizable guitar plays a more integral aspect amidst the sparkling electronic sounds. The application of up-tempo percussives adds a vivacious quality to the dreaminess, often resulting inrather dramatic passages. Shimmering tonalities share the sonic stage with urgent riffs and elegant crescendos. Dwane achieves a careful balance between power and calm, one that faces the sky with an open mind. The union of this strength and serenity can be felt in each textured note, as ethereal billows whirl into piercing expansions with comfortable ease. These compositions flaunt a sense of glory and wonder that is pleasantly gripping. The dynamics are tempered with restraint, producing 44 minutes of harmoniously glowing tuneage that is constantly hinting at outburst without ever losing perspective of the melody.&quot; -- Matt Howarth / Space.com\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c6f63dae74845d60dbd0ee7f92601f04d4477d4","amp;dn":"Mark+Dwane+-+Angels%2C+Aliens+%26+Archetypes+%28New+Age%2C+1991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c6f63dae74845d60dbd0ee7f92601f04d4477d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,111,99,218,231,72,69,214,13,189,14,231,249,38,1,240,77,68,119,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
