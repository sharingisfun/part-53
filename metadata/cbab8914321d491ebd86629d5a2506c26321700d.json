Humphrey Bogart chews the scenery in his star-making turn as acid-tongued private eye Sam Spade, whose association with the beautiful and aloof Brigid O&amp;#039;Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), neurotic Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), and morbidly obese Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in his Oscar-nominated screen debut) over the recovery of the title object, sets in motion a movie experience that is as much crackling as it is dazzling. While much of the action and dialogue is considerably dated by modern standards, the film&amp;#039;s essential power to mystify and entrance remains undiminished despite its age&quot;. \n\n&quot;Sam Spade is a partner in a private-eye firm who finds himself hounded by police when his partner is killed whilst tailing a man. The girl who asked him to follow the man turns out not to be who she says she is, and is really involved in something to do with the `Maltese Falcon&amp;#039;, a gold-encrusted life-sized statue of a falcon, the only one of its kind&quot;.\n\n \n[b]Video:[/b] PAL \n[b]Zone:[/b] 0 Free\n[b]Picture:[/b] 3:4; 1.33:1\n[b]Sound:[/b]   Dolby Digital 2 mono\n[b]Languaje:[/b] English, Spanish \n[b]Subtitles:[/b] English, Spanish, French, Deutch, and others\n[b]Length:[/b] 101 minutes\n[b]Categorie:[/b]   Thriller\n[b]Country/Year:[/b]  USA (1941)\n\n[b]RIPED DATA[/b]\n\nDVDDecrypter, DvdRemake 3.4, DVD Rebuilder Pro + HC 2 pass\nOrigen DVD9 =&gt; DVD5\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 7.373/2.755/3.748 Kbs\nStripped all warnings.\n\n\n[b]UPLOAD DETAILS[/b]\n\n[b]Conection:[/b] 25k UP\n[b]Seed Type:[/b] Normal\n[b]schedule:[/b] 24 hours\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbab8914321d491ebd86629d5a2506c26321700d","amp;dn":"The+Maltese+Falcon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbab8914321d491ebd86629d5a2506c26321700d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,171,137,20,50,29,73,30,189,134,98,157,90,37,6,194,99,33,112,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
