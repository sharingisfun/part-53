A reality that many jews in Israel see, but that Americans don't because CNN and others refuse to run such stories.\n\nThis off course amounts to censorship.\n\nA picture is also included of Israeli soldiers posing with a dead Palestinian.\n\nWe all know of the horrors of suicide bombings, but we are not given the reality of the Israeli occupation.\n\nSpread. Multiply.
