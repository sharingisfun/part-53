Show researcher, Steve Lewis, explained how this posed a challenge for the production crew: &quot;[It] is essential for the camera crew to work out a shooting script from the lyrics, so that [they] can point the camera at the drummer or guitarist at suitable points in the song.&quot; When Cobain did eventually arrive on set, with just an hour to go until the live transmittion, a second soundcheck/camera blocking rehearsal was hastily put together for &amp;#039;Lithium&amp;#039;.\n\nAll efforts to manage the production proved futile, however, as the band broke out into an impromtu and furiously intense version of &amp;#039;Territorial Pissings&amp;#039;. Initially, the show&amp;#039;s production crew didn&amp;#039;t realise that the band were playing a different song: &quot;The people in the production gallery didn&amp;#039;t realise. They couldn&amp;#039;t make out the words so they stuck to the shooting script for &amp;#039;Lithium&amp;#039;&quot;. By the time Lewis was able to flag down the production crew, the band were already trashing their equipment.\n\n&quot;When it was over, Dave Grohl walked past me and said, &amp;#039;sorry man&amp;#039;. And Phil Smith, their record company man, came up and said they&amp;#039;d pay for the damage, which unbelievably they did.&quot; \n\nA version of this is on their &amp;#039;Live Tonight Sold Out&amp;#039; VHS but that&amp;#039;s intercut with other live footage - this is the original broadcast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe900bdb452d02182270e7aa502659f41740d85","amp;dn":"Nirvana+%5C%27Territorial+Pissings%5C%27+on+Tonight+With+Jonathan+Ross+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe900bdb452d02182270e7aa502659f41740d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,233,0,189,180,82,208,33,130,39,14,122,165,2,101,159,65,116,13,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
