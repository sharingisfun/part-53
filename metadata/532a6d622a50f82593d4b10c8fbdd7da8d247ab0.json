I found the torrent file on a different tracker even though the torrent tracker announcer said it was from Pirtate Bay, I could not find a copy of the torrent here. \n\nI will seed this one. We need others to finish seeding the other parts 1-13. Many of us are stuck on CDs 8 thru 13. \n\nWe need seeds for the following torrents:\n\nBBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_8__Free_French_Forces\nBBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_9__The_Royal_Navy\nBBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_10_The_Anzacs\nBBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_11__Free_Polish_Forces\nBBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_12_The_Chindits\nBBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_13__Paras_and_Commandos\n\nMany of us are stuck at between 85% and 99.7% on most of these and 26.2% on #8.\n\nThere are quite a few of us that would appreciate a hand from those with full copies of any of the above.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532a6d622a50f82593d4b10c8fbdd7da8d247ab0","amp;dn":"cd+4+Desert+Rats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532a6d622a50f82593d4b10c8fbdd7da8d247ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,42,109,98,42,80,248,37,147,212,177,12,143,189,215,218,141,36,122,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
