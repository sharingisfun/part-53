This amalgamation of influences creates a sound that keeps the listener guessing, wondering what sound is coming next, whether in a live environment or on CD. \n\nTheir debut CD &amp;#039;Love Unoriginally&amp;#039; has been very well received by the local music community, its first run selling out in a matter of days. Best described as progressive folk rock, JTAR&amp;#039;s 6 track CD takes the listener on journey through the transfixing title track, to the hauntingly beautiful Stepping Outside, to the good old-fashioned rock stylings of Soap Scum.\n\nJust to Annoy Ray - Love Unoriginally\n1. Love Unoriginally\n2. Animosity\n3. Signs\n4. Here&amp;#039;s My War\n5. Stepping Outside\n6.
