British comedy seemed to be on the wane, but this is one of the best written, funniest shows around.\n\nExpect copycat shows using the same style of shooting POV any time soon. \n\n\nComedy-Series from England.\n\nhttp://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/P/peep_show/index.html\n\nAlso visit IMDB.com for more info!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc716cac60af3eb691c955d4e95cb60c0e75cc16","amp;dn":"Peep.Show.S02E01.WS.PDTV.XviD-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc716cac60af3eb691c955d4e95cb60c0e75cc16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,113,108,172,96,175,62,182,145,201,85,212,233,92,182,12,14,117,204,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
