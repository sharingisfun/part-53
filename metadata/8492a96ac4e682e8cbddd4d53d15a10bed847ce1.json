The title would have been entirely appropriate (as, indeed, is Vespertine, meaning &quot;pertaining to the evening&quot;). Ever since 1993's vital, effusive Debut, BjÃƒÂ¶rk's music has been increasingly intimate, gently private and concerned with seclusion. It's typical then that Vespertine's first single was called &quot;Hidden Place&quot;. The studious solitude is rewarding, though. Vespertine is a lush, gorgeous swell of mid-pace electronica, symphonic strings and BjÃƒÂ¶rk's uniquely alien, spectral vocal. There are fantastical wonders here.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://bjork.com/&quot;&gt;http://bjork.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indian.co.uk/&quot;&gt;http://www.indian.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polydor.co.uk/&quot;&gt;http://www.polydor.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NSXL/026-5332223-0846013&quot;&gt;http://amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NSXL/026-5332223-0846013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nVBR.
