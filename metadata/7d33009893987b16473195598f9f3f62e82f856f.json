Jin has a more traditional style but don`t think of this as a weakness because his skills are amazing. The two contrasting samurai warriors are far from friends, yet their separate paths seem to cross anyways. Mugen is wandering aimlessly through the woods when he stumbles upon a teahouse where he meets Jin and Fuu (A ditzy waitress, but don`t think she doesn`t have any hidden skills of her own). Fuu convinces them both to come with her in search of a mysterious samurai that smells like sunflowers and their journey begins. This modernized hip-hop tale breaks the barriers of the common, historical, samurai anime.\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img2.anidb.info/pics/anime/1983.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d33009893987b16473195598f9f3f62e82f856f","amp;dn":"Samurai+Champloo+1-26+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d33009893987b16473195598f9f3f62e82f856f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,51,0,152,147,152,123,22,71,49,149,89,143,159,63,98,232,47,133,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
