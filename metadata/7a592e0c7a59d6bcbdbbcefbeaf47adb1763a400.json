Their final attempt proves fruitful as General Yang is captured, but his partner dies in the ensuing battle. Taking a vacation after the chaotic event, Deaw is convinced by his little sister to take a trip to a rural village where she and their old classmates will pass out food and supplies to the villagers. But his vacation soon comes to a halt when the village is captured and held hostage by General Yang's men, who threatens to launch a nuke every hour he is not freed! After slaughtering half the villagers and rounding up the rest, General Yang's men make an ultimatum to the Prime Minister - either release Yang, or the rest of the villagers will die.\n\n\nActors:\tSuebsak Pansueb , Sasisa Jindamanee , Piyapong Piew On , Noppol Gomarachun , Dan Chupong , Amornthep Waewsang\nDirector(s):\tPrachya Pinkaew , Panna Rittikrai\n\nTHANKS TO WINMAN42 FOR THE SUBS.\n\nFile Name:              Born.To.Fight.2004.DVDRip.XviD-ACF.avi\nFile Size:              733,861,888 bytes\nDuration:               01:30:40\nVideo:                  XviD, 576 x 304 (1.895:1), 25.000 fps, 1038 kbps B-VOP  \nAudio:                  0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3 VBR, 48000 Hz, 131 kbps total (2 chnls)\nLanguage:               Thai\nSubtitles:              English Vobsubs\n\n\n\nFOR ASIAN MOVIES ON ED2K VISIT http://www.acfmovies.com/\n\n************************************************************\nHey!
