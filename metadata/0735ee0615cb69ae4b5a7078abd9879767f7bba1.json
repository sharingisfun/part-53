Former lead singer Matt Kramer wasn&amp;#039;t around for this one,\n and because his distinctive voice was such a big part of the Saigon Kick sound the results of this one had\n been questioned before release. However, Bieler--who had sung lots of background on the first two discs-\n-smashes through fabulously with the lead vocal duties. Also, the guitar sound once again sounds even better\n than before. The songs themselves seem a bit more simplistic, but the energy is still there. The band explores\n a few new directions as well, but their overall sound and style remains the same.\nHighlights include &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;Torture&quot;, &quot;Fields of Rape&quot; (great power ballad),\n &quot;I Love You&quot; (and another one), &quot;My Heart&quot;, &quot;Sentimental Girl&quot;, and &quot;Close to You&quot;.\n Also included is a great, soaring cover of David Bowie&amp;#039;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0735ee0615cb69ae4b5a7078abd9879767f7bba1","amp;dn":"Saigon+Kick+-+Water+%28Released+1993+%28Third+Stone%2FAtlantic%29%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0735ee0615cb69ae4b5a7078abd9879767f7bba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,53,238,6,21,203,105,174,75,90,112,120,171,217,135,151,103,247,187,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
