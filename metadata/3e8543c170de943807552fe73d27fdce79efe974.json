The third DVD with all six episodes of the series and a small bonusvid with some &amp;#039;things gone wrong&amp;#039; stuff. Series one and two are around (TPB I think) but this one wasn&amp;#039;t. Rippend and compressed with DVDShrink 3.2; gives a nice quality. Nothing removed; menu compressed to the max; episodes &amp; fluff around 60%; copyright replaced with the only True Lord. Only one audiotrack (English ofc) and only one language subs; Dutch.\n\nEpisodes: Hole, Terror, Break, Dough, Finger &amp; Carnival (all around 30min)\nExtra: 13min Fluf\n\nBecause I&amp;#039;m bandwithwise &amp;#039;challenged&amp;#039; getting a propper seedcount will take 2-3 days. In the meantime, have a wank! (When this is up I think I&amp;#039;ll up Believe Nothing next.)\n\nEnjoy! \n\n\n\nPS If, due to braindamage, you don&amp;#039;t know what Bottom is; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_(TV_series)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e8543c170de943807552fe73d27fdce79efe974","amp;dn":"Bottom+Series+3+-+DVD5ISO+-+Dutch+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e8543c170de943807552fe73d27fdce79efe974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,133,67,193,112,222,148,56,7,85,47,231,61,39,253,206,121,239,233,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
