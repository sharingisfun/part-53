Put the cue files in Alcohol 120% and mount cd-image #1 by double\n   clicking disc 1 in the alcohol window.\n2. Start the installation by clicking the install button on the\n   auto-run screen.\n   If you don't get the auto-run screen, go to &quot;My computer&quot; and then\n   double click the virtual cd-drive with the Lionhead logo.\n3. Use the Deviance keygenerator to get a serial number. It's pretty\n   slow, but at least it works.\n4. Mount the next image when needed (ALT-TAB).\n5. When you're done with everything, simply mount the first image disc\n   again and run the game!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: I got no connections to NOBODY and DEViANCE what so ever. \n           If you get anyproblems, read the install notes again or put\n           a comment on Piratebay or something.\n\nThanks to: Piratebay, isohunt, NOBODY, DEViANCE and my mom :D\n\nThis is my first torrent btw...\n\n\n\n- Orrefan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c16714084fd83792fa9c6d38170461778b1b3e7","amp;dn":"Black.and.White.2-Orre+%28with+keygen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c16714084fd83792fa9c6d38170461778b1b3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,22,113,64,132,253,131,121,47,169,198,211,129,112,70,23,120,177,179,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
