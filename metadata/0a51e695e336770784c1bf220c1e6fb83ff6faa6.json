Plot/Summary ??????????????????????\n\n\n     The year is 1997. Due to huge crime rates, the United States turns its \n     once great city of New York into a maximum security prison where hardcore \n     criminals are put for life. All the bridges leading into the city are \n     mined, a large wall is built along the shoreline and a large police force \n     army is based there to stop or kill any attempted escapees. En route to a \n     conference, the President, on board Air Force One, is forced to eject in \n     a pod when a female terrorist takes over the controls and crashes the \n     plane into a building. A new prisoner, ex-soldier Snake Plissken is \n     offered his freedom if he goes in, frees the President and finds a tape \n     with important information for the conference. Snake agrees but to ensure \n     his co-operation he is injected with a small but powerful explosive that \n     will only be destroyed if his mission is successful. Snake must set out \n     into the decaying city, filled with immoral criminals, and he must \n     succeed - for his own life.\n\n   \n                \n       ?????????????????????? Rippers notes ???????????????????? ???\n\n     I can just hear you scream nuke! Dupe VCDVault. well go right ahead.\n     But before you do, read this:\n     the VCDvault rells states the following: SiZE : 1CD 561MB, that is \n     undersize, in a big way, yes we know that it was made in 2000, maybe pre \n     TDX rules, we dont know, second thing: &quot;ReSoLuTiON  : 640 x 352 and DVD \n     ASPeCT  : 2.35:1&quot;, that in my book is called a severe fuck up in AR. also \n     they say: &quot;This movie is very dark and brings out the faults inherent in \n     DivX, It was encoded very high and still did not noticeably improve. \n     Please, don't think that filling the cd would have helped as then it \n     would he, harder to play for slower CPU's. Hmm ... how do we improve dark \n     DVD's.&quot; a friend of mine said he actually downloaded it some time ago, \n     and it was very poor quality, we have been unable to find it anywhere, so \n     we cant include sample, but imo the AR, and the size is NOT rippers \n     choise, its simply a fuck up. therefor, this proper, nuke if you like.  \n\n\n   ????? ????????????????????????
