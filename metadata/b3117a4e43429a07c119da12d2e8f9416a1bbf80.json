So our friend download it, but then after a few \n hours waiting for the download... (dialup sux *_* ) we were all sober and\n just say fuck it, left home. Come back the next day it was like 90 percent\n done and finally done after 2 hours and we got drunk and play and have fun!\n But man, we could've done this earlier rather than wait, we didn't expect\n this from RARE, especialy when alot of new groups out there that has no\n knowledge, just rips original and release, we didn't expect an oldie group\n like Rare to do this, i guess this goes to show that Rare doesn't have the\n right stuff and uses the same shit like other groups do and now since they\n have like No idea if this will work fine or not, they just do unstripped\n releases now? Shame, thats how we would feel if we used those shitty\n public wiping tools avalible to the public no?  Over 750 megs of garbage\n found in this game! so we are like, fuck this, strip it all with the right\n stuff (Our coder like knows it too so does like hundreds out there scared\n to do it so Nintendo will find them and fire them!)  We know its a day old\n , we know its lame to a few sceners, but ask yourselve this, you guys \n wouldn't know a proper when you see one, why even that Cobra nfo says\n garbage is not needed, We think even Nintendo UK said the same thing once a \n long ass time ago especially when its gets decrypted and turns to 1 percent\n compression, but oh well. Doesn't work with GCSIM (sad *_*) but it works fine\n with Viper now, choose video mode (Real UK Bums choose 50!) and play!\n You can scan , you can look on how the GC lens reads at the edge of the disc\n (Sounds like padding with FST fixer no?), We played this for hours ( And used\n something sexy to us all..)! Just to show you that garbage isn't needed :/\n we hope some people will learn but we doubt it, especially since they can't \n code for shit on a good stripping tool, Wipe seems to work also btw... Love \n them memorex minis!\n\n since this game is nonsense party fun, PROST crew recommends you enjoy it\n with:\n\n PROST-CREW'S PROPERED Rum n Coke!\n \n  5.0 oz. of Cola (Pepsi for you wimps!)\n  2.0 oz of Light Rum (Hard Rum for men!)\n  Supplment ingredient, a Prostitute at Suffix! \n\n  Shaken not stirred! Or whatever, its all good with babes n friends!\n\n\n  enjoy and watch for more 10mbit rippers!\n\n=[.contact]================================================================\n\n the easiest way to find us is after you drink so much, you no longer can \n see your own hands. lay down for a few minutes and we will come to you.\n\n you can try to write us at ... oh shit we lost our email!\n\n dont expect a response unless you cry outloud!\n\n=[.prost]==================================================================\n\n PROST 2005 - Saufen bis zum Knast!
