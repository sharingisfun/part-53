I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named &quot;b2pilot187&quot;. Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be solved sooner than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nReVIsed alias Masterpiece\n\nSynopsis:\n\nmigi wrote: &quot;It's a program about what happend on 9/11, it includes interviews with 2 former ministers, Michael Meacher from England and Andreas von B&amp;uuml;low from Germany... they say things about 9/11 you and I are always saying, but the rest of the world is unfortunetly not (yet).\n\nVery good program, (considering the fact it was on meanstream TV during primetime, and the fact that finally 2 prominent Ministers are saying it)&quot;\n\nName.........: 911_Attack_Or_Gift_From_Heaven.-.Dutch_TV_090905_DivX5.avi\nFilesize.....: 60.5 MB\nRuntime......: 00:20:59\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 264 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nRip/translat.: Jolanda\n\nName.........: 911_Attack_Or_Gift_From_Heaven_(Meacher_Bulow_Interview).-.Dutch_TV_090905_DivX5.avi\nFilesize.....: 147.5 MB\nRuntime......: 00:56:33\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 306 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 48 kb/s (48/ch, monophonic) VBR\nFrame Size...: 360x270 (1.33:1) [=4:3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd0061c816a05cf1fed60cf4c1a8b7f6a3cdb63","amp;dn":"911+-+Attack+or+Gift+from+Heaven%3F+%28Eng.+Subs+-+Dutch+TV+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd0061c816a05cf1fed60cf4c1a8b7f6a3cdb63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,208,6,28,129,106,5,207,31,237,96,207,76,26,139,127,106,60,219,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
