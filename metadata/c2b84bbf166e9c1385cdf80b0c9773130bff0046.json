Cab driving may be fun, but it was just a job for this crew, most of whom were working part-time as they tried to make it in other fields. Alex Rieger, the most experienced and most conservative of the group, was the only full-time driver. Bobby Wheeler was a frustrated actor, waiting for his big break; Elaine Nardo was an art gallery receptionist, trying to pick up a few extra bucks; Tony Banta, the boxer who never won a fight; and John Burns, the student and all-around lost soul. Latka Gravas was the company's mechanic, of indeterminate nationality and fractured english, and Louie De Palma was the dispatcher, a pint-sized petty tyrant who ran things from a wire cage in the center of the garage. Joining the cast in the second season was &quot;Reverend Jim&quot; Ignatowski, a spaced-out ex-hippie. (Tim's TV Showcase)\n\nCast &amp; Characters\n\n? Judd Hirsch as Alex Reiger \n?
