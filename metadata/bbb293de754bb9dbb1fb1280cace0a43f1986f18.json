In reality, it is 200 years later, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced artificial intelligence machines. The computers have created a false version of 20th-century life--the &quot;Matrix&quot;--to keep the human slaves satisfied, while the AI machines draw power from the humans. Anderson, pursued constantly by &quot;Agents&quot; (computers who take on human form and infiltrate the Matrix), is hailed as &quot;The One&quot; who will lead the humans to overthrow the machines and reclaim the Earth.\n\nTagline: Be Afraid Of The Future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbb293de754bb9dbb1fb1280cace0a43f1986f18","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+%28dvdrip.xvid.ac3.avi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbb293de754bb9dbb1fb1280cace0a43f1986f18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,178,147,222,117,75,185,219,177,251,18,128,202,206,10,67,241,152,111,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
