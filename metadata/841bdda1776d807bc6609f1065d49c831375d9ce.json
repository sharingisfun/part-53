From increased governmental surveilance to corporate content restrictions and data brokers, what you do, where you go, and who you talk to is of more interest to more people every day.\n\nAnonym.OS is an OpenBSD 3.8 Live CD with strong tools for anonymizing and encrypting connections. Standard network applications are provided and configured to take advantage of the tor onion routing network.\n\nAnonym.OS was first suggested by dr.kaos at Interzone 4 in Atlanta, March of 2005. Nearly a year and a lot of marathon coding sessions later, it&amp;#039;s a reality and was released by elmore, fade, arcon, dr.kaos, digunix, atlas and beth of kaos.theory at Shmoocon 2006.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:841bdda1776d807bc6609f1065d49c831375d9ce","amp;dn":"ANONYM.OS-SHMOO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"841bdda1776d807bc6609f1065d49c831375d9ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,27,221,161,119,109,128,123,198,96,159,16,101,212,156,131,19,117,217,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
