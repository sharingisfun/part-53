Two of these, Dekalog 5 and 6, have since been expanded into longer, feature-length films--Krotki film o zabijaniu (A Short Film About Killing) and Krotki film o milosci (A Short Film About Love), respectively. They deal with the emotional turmoil suffered by humanity, when instinctual acts and societal morality conflict.\n\nVideo is DVD Recoded\nAudio is Polish\nSubs are English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f7b79024db021b912bb03ba1a20b7497675e805","amp;dn":"Dekalog+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f7b79024db021b912bb03ba1a20b7497675e805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,123,121,2,77,176,33,185,18,187,3,186,26,32,183,73,118,117,232,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
