Seing in the light, of Mike's departure, and Wes' rejoin, i thought it would be cool to remember the old day with some good ol' Wes shows... But, but, but. As the third part of this week, I decided to give you one of the in my opinion best live shows with Mike, and perhaps one of the best faith-perfomances by Fred! Mike or Wes... Either way, a great show!\n\ngo to www.back2bizkit.net and get your say on what should be the next torrent!!\n\n~kaw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcf0ac3ea2f111559b657362ddee91db41082713","amp;dn":"Limp+Bizkit+-+Pepsi+Smash+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcf0ac3ea2f111559b657362ddee91db41082713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,240,172,62,162,241,17,85,155,101,115,98,221,238,145,219,65,8,39,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
