Gameplay is a fast, action-packed, and centers around the unique blow-by-blow Action/Reaction game system . Because of this, you get to maneuver on enemy aircraft, shoot them down, watch as they react to your actions, and get to respond with your own maneuvers and reactions, all in an intriguing easy to play and yet realistic game system. However, DiF is not a flight simulator. While aircraft capabilities and movement are modeled, the focus of the game is on the immediate action and excitement of dogfighting, not the excessive number crunching and flight physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e99c094f818045e501f312690a8a58d3e48e1980","amp;dn":"PC+-+Down+In+Flames+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e99c094f818045e501f312690a8a58d3e48e1980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,156,9,79,129,128,69,229,1,243,18,105,10,138,88,211,228,142,25,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
