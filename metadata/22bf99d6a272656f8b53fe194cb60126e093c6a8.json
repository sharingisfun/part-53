There a versions of this tool avaiable. One is a bit \nolder than the other one. I tested the newer one. Here is a little manual \nfor you all.\n\n1. RUN SFAFSB.EXE\n\n2. click install the driver and press &quot;ok&quot; to put the needed information into your registry\n\n3. restart your computer\n\n4. RUN SFAFSB.EXE click start the driver\n\n5. Get yourself a copy of Splinter Cell Chaos in mdf/mds format made with \nAlcohol 120%. The mds-file has to contain the DPM-information (DPM= Data \nPosition Measurement). The mdf-filesize for Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is 4,15 \ngigabyte (PAR SNAKE RELEASE).\n\n6. Mount the image and install the game.\n\n7. Start Starforce Nightmare 1.12 and disable your internal ide-Cd and \nDVD-drives (DISABLE CD) and also disable node (DISABLE NODE)\n\n8. Now start the game while the sfcure-driver is started and starforce \nwill verify that the mounted image is real. (Some of you maybe have to \nrestart your computer because Starforce tells you to do this)\n\n9. Enjoy Splinter Cell Chaos Theory without an USB-drive!\n\nNOTE THIS : I MUST CLICK RETRY CHECKING DISK WITH PAR SNAKES KEY AND USSUALY IT TAKE 3-TIMES TO RETRY, BUT I HAVE ALSO 2, 4 OR MORE TIMES BUT YES IT WORKS THANX TO alb AND TONY BTW IT WAS AT TPB HERE http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3391206 AND THERE WAS LINK TO RAPIDSHERE I DONT KNOW IT BUT I DL IT FROM THERE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bf99d6a272656f8b53fe194cb60126e093c6a8","amp;dn":"SPLINTER+CELL+CHAOS+THEORY+WORKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bf99d6a272656f8b53fe194cb60126e093c6a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,191,153,214,162,114,101,111,139,83,254,25,76,182,1,38,224,147,198,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
