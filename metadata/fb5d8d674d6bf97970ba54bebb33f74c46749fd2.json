The modifications had been made with the help of nLite. \n\nIn a way it is similar to Tiny XP, only has a little more (like 16 bit file support for some 16 bit programs like Borland Pascal, ping.exe, ipconfig.exe, etc). It is an excelent Windows for the gamer, webber, emailer, but can handle office programs to, well everything. Also it has a lot of full software included.\n\nMore info can be found at http://nrg88.4ya.us/page_2-3_.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5d8d674d6bf97970ba54bebb33f74c46749fd2","amp;dn":"NRG_XP_6.07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5d8d674d6bf97970ba54bebb33f74c46749fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,93,141,103,77,107,249,121,112,186,84,190,187,51,247,76,70,116,159,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
