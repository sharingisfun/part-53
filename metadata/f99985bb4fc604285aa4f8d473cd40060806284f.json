No matter time a day, you have some kind of a feeling that you need to play those old very fun 16-bit's games.\n\nI haven't really checked all the games, but I'd say it would be like 800 games, and many may be copys.\n\nI also included the best SNES Emu so you can play the games too ;)\nWith this Snes Emu you can play online, on 2 player games. Like Turtles or bomberman (my favorites ;)). You can spend houer after houer just keeping play theese games. And the time will flew a way. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99985bb4fc604285aa4f8d473cd40060806284f","amp;dn":"Super+Nintendo+Spel+%28SNES+SPEL%29-Jayman89","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99985bb4fc604285aa4f8d473cd40060806284f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,153,133,187,79,198,4,40,90,164,248,212,115,205,64,6,8,6,40,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
