Both had played in a band before, but they were not all that successful in those days. In 1989, van Veen was a music journalist for a national newspaper, 'De Volkskrant'. He wrote some articles about &quot;The New Dance Craze&quot;. \nTogether with the famous resident dj of 'The Roxy' club in Amsterdam, Eddy De Clercq, he produced 'Pay The Piper' A-Men. It is generally argued to be the first Dutch house record, although Peter Slaghuis from Rotterdam was a pioneer too. \n\nCycle, van Veen, and De Clercq had their first underground hit with 'Dish &amp; Tell' as 'House of Venus', part of which was sampled by Prince. The first Quazar record was 'Seven Stars'. It was picked up by a broad audience (even mellow-oriented dj's played it), but it was definitely a milestone for hard (euro) techno. \nThe second release (Here &amp; Now) is also quite experimental. It features an intro by Urban Dance Squad guitar player RenÃƒÂ© 'Tres Manos' Van Barnerveld. The remix edition features the often underestimated, slighty melodic techno tune, 'Midsummernightsdream'. \n\nQuazar rose to &quot;world fame in The Netherlands&quot;, when they were featured in the classic documentary, 'House gewoon uit je dak', in the Impact series by the Dutch VARA-television. They even managed to penetrate the booming market for (album) CD's. Their outstanding first album 'The Seven Stars' sold well over 10.000 copies. \nLater attempts were made to appeal to a more general audience. Their tracks became more song-like in format, and vocals (by Farida Merville) got more emphasis. Unfortunately things didn't quite work out for them. Gert van Veen still uses the name Quazar for his projects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26de872ffc1537ec76160ec916df8d93111df832","amp;dn":"Quazar+-+Seven+Stars+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26de872ffc1537ec76160ec916df8d93111df832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,222,135,47,252,21,55,236,118,22,14,201,22,223,141,147,17,29,248,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
