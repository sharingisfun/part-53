Inexplicably an english-sung version, ready to release, was never issued.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½-IP\n\nActually, only some of the tracks are re-recorded in English. The English version was issued by Mellow Records in Italy as sort of a mini-album but they have never responded to my queries.\n\nThis is a great album with classical and rock influences, some excellent electronic sounds and dynamic vocals. \n\nThere is a bonus single A-Side from 1973 included and I have included front covers of the official and Mexican bootleg singles.\nEnjoy!\nBrainticket\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df94f1b2232fb643facb28ad2919243794d486b","amp;dn":"Il+Balletto+Di+Bronzo+-+Ys+%28Italian+Prog+1972%29%28256%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df94f1b2232fb643facb28ad2919243794d486b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,249,79,27,34,50,251,100,63,172,178,138,210,145,146,67,121,77,72,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
