The booty not only leads them to the mythical mausoleum,\n      but it also connects Jack to his dark past life. \n\n      Through strange and provocative dreams, Jack sees himself \n      reincarnated as Meng Yi, a general who fell for the First\n      Emperor's beautiful consort Ok Soo (starring Kim Hee-seon) some\n      2000 years ago. As Meng Yi commands his troops in an increasingly\n      desperate war against rebels, he also has to battle his own inner\n      desires in choosing between eternity love and loyalty, Returning\n      to the present day, the final secret of the First Emperor is about\n      to be revealed. The two adventurers successfully enter the Heavenly\n      Palace, a fortress loaded with death traps and unspeakable evils,\n      as Jack comes face-to-face with his past.
