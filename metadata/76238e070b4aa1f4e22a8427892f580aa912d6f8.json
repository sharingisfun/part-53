There are several other adaptations (different years) but this is the best one in our opinion.\n\nSeems like ep 1-10 had been released in English but there seems to be no news regarding 11+. Thus, we started with ep 11.\n\nThis is the first release of our work. We are just a group of people who love wuxia series and want to share this experience with everyone. (http://azalae.com/fansub) Please bear with us if there is any mistake.\n\nP.S. If you noticed, we don't have any name yet. In our enthusiasm, we just forgot to decide on group names, and just start working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76238e070b4aa1f4e22a8427892f580aa912d6f8","amp;dn":"Xiao+Ao+Jiang+Hu+2001+-+Ep+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76238e070b4aa1f4e22a8427892f580aa912d6f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,35,142,7,11,74,161,244,226,42,132,39,137,47,88,10,169,18,214,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
