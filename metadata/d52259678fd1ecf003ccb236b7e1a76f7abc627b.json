These slaughterers want political power. In the south, militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr unleashes his militia on US Marines policing Najaf. The two forces battle hand-to-hand in a 1,000-year-old cemetery. In central Iraq, a skilled insurgent mortar team tries to disrupt national elections by targeting polling places in and around Fallujah. Marine Recon squads quietly hunt them down and kill them one-by-one. In the northern city of Mosul, Uday and Qusay Hussein, sons of Saddam, help plan and fund insurgent training and operations. US Special Forces and 101st Airborne troops surround their hardened, reinforced hideout and decimate it. For Iraq's &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, the message is clear: surrender and you might live; resist and you'll crumble in a storm of lead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d52259678fd1ecf003ccb236b7e1a76f7abc627b","amp;dn":"Shootout%21+Iraq%5C%27s+Most+Wanted+-+MPn+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d52259678fd1ecf003ccb236b7e1a76f7abc627b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,34,89,103,143,209,236,240,3,204,178,54,183,225,167,111,122,188,98,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
