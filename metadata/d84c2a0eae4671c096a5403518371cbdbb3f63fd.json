I think I did pretty well, but there are still some rock dull moments in it: The stairway (too many random encounters) and the materia-setting before the Bizarro fight (I didn't even use the other group...) Other than that, it's pretty enjoyable watch in my opinion.\n\nThe videos are in Ogg Theora format - I recommend VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to play them.\n\n - wwwwolf\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d84c2a0eae4671c096a5403518371cbdbb3f63fd","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VII+Endgame","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d84c2a0eae4671c096a5403518371cbdbb3f63fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,76,42,14,174,70,113,192,150,165,64,53,24,55,28,189,187,63,99,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
