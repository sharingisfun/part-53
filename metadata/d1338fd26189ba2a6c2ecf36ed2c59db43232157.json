The days of Mecca, Medina, the battles of early muslims against the unfaithful and how they tried to deliver the message to the outer world. It shows the struggle of the new faithful inside their very souls and outside in their refusing community.\n\nI hope it gives some idea about the real Islam, the one that differs totally from what we see every now and then by muslim hands.\n\nPeace be with you\n\nTip: I will try to provide arabic subtitles later. See the underlying comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1338fd26189ba2a6c2ecf36ed2c59db43232157","amp;dn":"The+Message+%28The+Story+Of+Islam%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1338fd26189ba2a6c2ecf36ed2c59db43232157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,51,143,210,97,137,186,42,108,46,207,54,237,44,89,219,67,35,33,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
