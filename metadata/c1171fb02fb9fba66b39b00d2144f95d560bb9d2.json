Here we have his \nfirst solo album and as with Gerd Wienekamp\u0019 s (the other half of \nRainbow Serpent) album \u0018 Kontakt\u0019 what we get is a mixture of very \nrecognisable Serpent characteristics as well as a different angle \nidentifying the individuality of each member.\n\nThis is something of a concept album following the passage of a series \nof dreams. Cosmic shimmers act as a gentle introduction to \u0018 Traum \n1\u0019 but then a great whoosh of sound descends on us like a tidal \nwave. A gorgeous shimmering lead line then grabs the focus and a \nbass beat forms a solid structure on which a sequence starts to \nemerge and another brighter rhythm is layered over the top. An \nenergetic driving number providing a splendid start. Each track runs \ninto each other so we move straight into \u0018 Traum 2\u0019 a very melodic \npiano lead piece. \u0018 Traum 3\u0019 is a marked contrast to the previous \nnumber as we are immediately treated to dark synth drones. A \ndelicate echoing motif is repeated and each time left to hang in the air \nuntil it fades away. A sequence emerges out of the dark but just acts \nas the backbone to a rather sleepy but hypnotic section. It is only \nafter seven minutes that things start to take off and we get more \numph! \u0018 Traum 4\u0019 introduces a superb heavy rhythm over which \nfloats a sublime melody. For the final minute and a bit we return to \nthe world of shifting images.\n\n\u0018 Traum 5\u0019 uses a faintly tribal rhythm, flute and didgeridoo. The didg \nis an instrument I don\u0019 t usually like on New Age Synth (EM) albums but \nhere it fits perfectly. At two minutes the rhythm becomes rather \nmanic then fades back again to allow Gothic chants to be heard, it all \nworks superbly. I know some of you will be put off by the description \nof this track, don\u0019 t be it is extremely inventive, effective and not \nremotely cliched. We then return to the watery shifting thoughts of \nbackground sleep. \u0018 Traum 6\u0019 retains the flute sound from before \nbut then a sequence takes its first descriptively mellow steps. Another \nhigher register one is layered over the top then more and more until I \nlose count of all the different lines involved. Superb stuff! More cosmic \nbleeps and twitters take us into \u0018 Traum 7\u0019 . From atmospheric \nbeginnings a bass (non dance) rhythm very slowly unfolds then we \nget a steam train making its stately progress down the line. More \natmospheric pads are used as the backdrop to a melodic sequence. \nThis is a beautiful track and for me is the standout number on the \nalbum. We flow from one stunning melodic sequence to the next and \nthe underpinning pads are just heavenly. Now on to the final Traum. \nThe sequences are now menacing but are added to by a more playful \none at around the four minute mark. We are dreaming again but this \nseems like a disturbed and unsettled sleep from which we will be \npleased to wake.\n\nSo to sum up this album has sequences a plenty but don\u0019 t expect \nthem to be of the thunderous earthquake or a million mile an hour \nvariety. What you have here is quite an emotional album but in the \nbest sense and not remotely twee. \n  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.17 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1171fb02fb9fba66b39b00d2144f95d560bb9d2","amp;dn":"Frank+Specht+-+Sebastian+im+Traum+-+newage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1171fb02fb9fba66b39b00d2144f95d560bb9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,23,31,176,47,185,251,166,107,57,176,13,33,68,249,93,86,11,185,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
