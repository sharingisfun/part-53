Since scientists can trace humanity&amp;#039;s origins back 500 times as far?to almost 2.5 million years ago?sometimes the desire to explore questions like these cannot be satisfied by the pages of written history. The place for you to turn, as this course will show, is to archaeology. \n\nPart meticulous empirical science and part inspired detective work, archaeology seeks answers about the obscure reaches of the past by using techniques and insights from a wealth of other fields, including geology, anthropology, history, physics, art history, and even philosophy?along with long hours in the field studying the physical traces that our forebears have left behind.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles \n\n1-  What is Archaeology? \n2-  The Scientific Underpinnings \n3-  Historians, Treasure Hunters, and Antiquarians \n4-  The Fathers of Scientific Excavation \n5-  Preservation of Archaeological Remains \n6-  Stratigraphic and Sequence Dating \n7-  Seriation, Ancient Sources, and Sediments \n8-  Dating Using Flora and Fauna \n9-  Radiocarbon and Potassium-Argon Dating \n10- Other Scientific Dating Methods \n11- Archaeological Survey \n12- Excavation \n13- Interpreting Finds \n14- Stone Tools \n15- Pottery \n16- Bones \n17- Features and Structures \n18- Reconstructing Ancient Cultures \n19- Archaeological Theories about Change \n20- Paleolithic Art \n21- The Neolithic Revolution \n22- Ãƒâ€¡atal HÃƒÂ¼yÃƒÂ¼k \n23- The Rise of Civilizations \n24- Archaeology and Ethics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fadffbeaca02d5e70a39f3a7326eba7a61be3dce","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Susan+Foster+McCarter+-+Introduction+to+Archeology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fadffbeaca02d5e70a39f3a7326eba7a61be3dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,223,251,234,202,2,213,231,10,57,243,167,50,110,186,122,97,190,61,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
