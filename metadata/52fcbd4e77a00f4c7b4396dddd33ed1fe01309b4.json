The 8 tracks are:\n\n1. My Breathing\n2. Unknown And Hostile\n3. The Sleeproom\n4. New Thing From London Town\n5. I Can&amp;#039;t Stop\n6. Strange Charm\n7. The Need\n8. This Is Love\n\nVinyl tracks were ripped with LP Ripper 4 and cleaned up with Cool Edit Pro 2.0 (still one of the best audio editors going even if they did rename it to Adobe Audition 1.5).\n\nI haven&amp;#039;t had time to check the tracks so I hope they are okay.\n\nIf you like download.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52fcbd4e77a00f4c7b4396dddd33ed1fe01309b4","amp;dn":"Gary+Numan+-+Strange+Charm+%28Vinyl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52fcbd4e77a00f4c7b4396dddd33ed1fe01309b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,252,189,78,119,160,15,76,123,67,150,221,221,51,237,31,224,19,9,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
