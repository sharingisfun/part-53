Players have the freedom to follow each of the four storylines through for the ultimate character-driven experience, or they can engage in the historic battles chronologically for quick hitting action.\n\nInfinity Ward, creator of the blockbuster, original Call of Duty, has also expanded the scope of combat to deliver a truly realistic battlefield experience. Squads now have the freedom to take on a variety of mission objectives, on expansive battlefields that allow for multiple paths and the ability to utilize actual combat tactics like outflanking and fire and maneuver capabilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863eba4edae7eed0042d00e7d42483a9e667c9c7","amp;dn":"Call+of+duty+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863eba4edae7eed0042d00e7d42483a9e667c9c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,62,186,78,218,231,238,208,4,45,0,231,212,36,131,169,230,103,201,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
