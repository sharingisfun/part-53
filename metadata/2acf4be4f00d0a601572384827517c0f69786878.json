Once the bubble burst Aum had not only become one of the largest and most profitable cults in Japan, they had launched a worldwide membership campaign and established multi-million dollar business ventures in Asia, Europe, the US, Australia and the Former Soviet Union. \n\nThe effort was an unprecedented success that would net a membership estimated to be three times larger in Russia than in Japan and allowed Asahara to forge alliances with top Government officials including the Chairman of the Russian Security Council. Using these connections to further expand their network, Aum began actively and successfully seeking Russian arms dealers, fire sales at chemical weapons labs, machinery to manufacture firearms and scored a fully operational Russian gunship helicopter. \n\nAll the while Asahara was tightening his grip on the members of Aum, many of which were University educated biologists, scientists or chemists pushing them to work faster - they had little time left.\n\nAccording to Asahara the Apocalypse was extremely fucking nigh! \n\nNow entrenched in multi-million dollar compounds all over Japan and protected from any form of governmental investigation by the 1947 Religious Corporation Law, Asahara began unveiling his Supreme Truth and the ultimate goal of Aum Shinrikyo. Not only would Aum survive the fast approaching Armageddon - Aum would cause it. \n\nMaking incredibly effective use of tactics like brain washing, economic dependence on the cult, fear, drugs, murder and even two industrial microwaves to dispose of the bodies of perceived threats, Asahara had spun a web of unprecedented strength and trapped an army of religious fanatics willing to obey his every word. \n\nAn army who would not only condone, but carry out indiscriminate wholesale murder underneath the world?s largest city on a bright Monday morning and never doubt they were indeed doing Gods Work.  \n\nAnd that's only the tip of the iceberg as they say.... \n================================================================================\n\nA few other highlights of Aum Shinrikyo's rise to fame include:\n\n-&gt; Murder of at least one high ranking Judge and his family     \n-&gt; Repeated tests of Anthrax, VX, sarin, etc. on the general public\n-&gt; Ritualistic abuse of Aum members \n-&gt; Wholesale manufacture of LSD and crystal-meth for the Yakuza\n-&gt; Kidnap/intimidation/murder of families seeking release of Aum members   \n-&gt; Infiltration of Japanese, Russian, US and Australian government\n-&gt; Sustained inquiry seeking nuclear waste and warheads\n-&gt; Evidence Aum may have detonated a nuclear device in Australia\n\nMuch like September 11th in the United States, the sarin gas attacks have forever changed Japanese life. \n\nConsider for a moment that even at its highest point, Aum Shinrikyo had far fewer than the 8 million members claimed by the Church of  Scientology today and enjoyed little if any societal approval the latter has been afforded.\n\nNow think of how many other 'doomsday' cults exist in the US alone &amp; keep those thoughts in mind as you read these documents which tell the tale of Shoko Asahara and followers of Aum Shinrikyo.\n================================================================================\n\n10 Point Introduction to the world of Aum Shinrikyo\n\n================================================================================\n\nThe following documents should give readers a more than adequate introduction to the history of Shoko Asahara, the Aum Shinrikyo cult and events leading to March 20, 1995 when sarin gas was released in Tokyo?s massive underground subway system and the ongoing effect the attack has left on Japanese life and the world community as a whole. \n\n01 - Aum Shinrikyo / Aum Supreme Truth Wikipedia Entry\n02 - CrimeLibrary.com History of Aum Shinrikyo\n03 - US Senate Subcommittee Case Study on Aum Shinrikyo\n04 - Day Of Judgment - Yomiuri Shimbun In Depth Series\n05 - Sentencing of Asahara - Richard Gardne for Newsweek \n06 - Review of Murakamis Underground by Ian Hacking\n07 - On The Revival of Aum - Andrew Marshall\n08 - On Aum Conspiracy Theories - Garry Greenwood\n09 - Rand Corp.
