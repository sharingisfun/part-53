I don't think this album is available at all anymore. \n\nI got it on DAT many years ago and it was recorded at LP (long play) so the DAT recording is 32 kHz / 8 bits non-linear, but the music is not that demanding so I think the sound quality is very good. Upsampled to 44.1 kHz and then MP3 coded at 256 kbit/s by Sony Sound Forge 8.\n\nI will try to upload his &quot;Trans Harmonic Nights&quot; too if I have success with this, my first torrent upload.\n\nI want more people to enjoy his music and this seems to be the only way to spread his wisdom. No one sells his albums.\n\nCheck out this page: http://www.discogs.com/release/66772\n\n1 Bicentennial Present\n2 Romance\n3 Phase By Phase\n4 Meadow Of Infinity (Part 1)\n5 The Glass Bridge\n6 Meadow Of Infinity (Part 2)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77d81df50dfabab804d34582ae52d75ca5aee01a","amp;dn":"Peter+Baumann+-+Romance+76","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77d81df50dfabab804d34582ae52d75ca5aee01a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,216,29,245,13,250,186,184,4,211,69,130,174,82,215,92,165,174,224,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
