I havent added or removed anything from the original, this is as I downloaded it. A highly recommended album.\n\n[img]http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/images/RiR-RiR.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n\nFrom progreviews.com:\n\n\nThe reissue of this mid-70s Swedish obscurity is probably best compared to the likes of Uriah Heep and Kaipa, but what I can't get out of my mind are Swedish contemporaries BlÃƒÂ¥kulla. Like that band, who released an equally obscure 1975 self-titled album, RÃƒÂ¥g i Ryggen play a heavy psych/symphonic hybrid with a fairly evident Yes influence in places. Everything about this album screams 70s psych: the fuzzy guitar tone, the prevalence of Hammond organ, the bubbling Squire-ish bass. All the songs are constructed with melody as a first priority, and the result is a solid, remarkably accessible, if somewhat cheesy effort.\n\nThe band missteps big-time with its English-language songs, though ? the lyrics to &quot;You Know It Ain't Easy&quot; and &quot;Queen of Darkness&quot; are atrociously embarrassing, and the music seems much simplified in these pieces as well (&quot;Naked Man&quot; fares better). But songs like the opener, &quot;SpÃƒÂ¥ngaforsens Brus&quot; and &quot;Sanningsserum&quot; make up for these with some good old-fashioned rocking, characterized by upbeat vocals, spiraling guitar solos and irrepressibly catchy rhythms. Hipsters looking for the more obscure roots of the inexplicably popular Swedish neo-psych group Dungen's trademark sound would do well to look here.\n\nA brief set of three live bonus tracks is tacked on to the end of this reissue; the first two are songs taken from this album but are of virtually unlistenably bad audio quality. The last track was recorded on a different date and sounds substantially better, although musically the song doesn't really stand up to the best pieces on the original album. Overally though, this reissue is a worthy find for fans of this little niche (certainly a better effort than the rather overrated BlÃƒÂ¥kulla); fun stuff that, for better or worse, sounds solidly rooted in its time and place.\n\n\n\n192 VBR \nCovers included\n\n1.
