Once again it's mould-breaking, demonically-inspired television.\n\nSafran has teamed up with his maverick match in wit and weird wisdom, Father Bob Maguire. Father Bob and John first met when John took Father Bob to the flicks in John Safran vs. God. They bonded over chocolates and The Passion of the Christ and John even worked as Father Bob's altar boy. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79805b9dbe1b1c4010c684167293e5af2b351da4","amp;dn":"2005-12-12-Mon+21%3A00+COMEDY+SERIES%3A+SPEAKING+IN+TONGUES.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79805b9dbe1b1c4010c684167293e5af2b351da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,128,91,157,190,27,28,64,16,198,132,22,114,147,229,175,43,53,29,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
