Working as a spy for both sides he tries to play the 3rd reich and the British against each other. The real life Chapman described himself as a completely &amp;#039;amoral&amp;#039; person, which adds a nice philisophical touch to this somewhat colourful spy-flic. Is there any moral in making war ? Even if you&amp;#039;re the &amp;#039;good&amp;#039; fighting &amp;#039;evil&amp;#039;?\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\nSubtitles:\nSwedish\nNorwegian\nFinnish\nDanish\n\nPAL &amp; DVD5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef2ce2f51675fc570e54a46b23fd23f1e49f26e","amp;dn":"Triple.Cross.1966.PAL-KESSLER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef2ce2f51675fc570e54a46b23fd23f1e49f26e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,242,206,47,81,103,95,197,112,229,74,70,178,63,210,63,30,73,242,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
