I prefer &quot;install and forget&quot;, and make it all a little bit more simply.\n\nI decide to use a small file to test my abilities. I saw, some guys have problems to share addons, so i test it well, first.\n\nI collect addons over 4 Years, hold them up to date, and looking daily for new stuff. So i have a huge archive, easy to install high quality addons. For FS2004 only. I delete as well all FS2002 files to save place. Im not a friend of unclear archives, long filenames and so. Now is time, to give you all back what i collect abouve the years from much different p2p networks.\n\nHere i share a small but fine program to cache your harddrive: SystemboosterXP v1&amp;2\n\n-&gt; systembooster.com/about.htm\n\nThis program holds which it promises, it&amp;#039;s very nice to use, too.\n\nUse Version 1 if you are a beginner.\nAnd Version 2 if you know how the program works and you want some more options.\n\nI have no serial, but i use RTKF (included) to reset the 30 days counter. Start Systembooster and choose &quot;evaluate&quot;. You can use this program with all features. And reset the counter all 30 days isn&amp;#039;t a big problem.\n\nTo reset the counter, start rtkf (trashreg.exe). Delete only the four entries with the extension like:\n\n&quot;Version&quot;=hex:00,fa,00,ff,00, ...........\n\nIn the mousecursor popup description you can read something like &quot;trial creator 1+&quot;. That&amp;#039;s the right entry, delte them, and the counter is reset to zero.\n\n\nTo complete my collections, and share the packages as well i need some help and request today:\n\n\nFSD Pilatus Porter v2\nfsd-international.com/projects/porter.htm\n\nFSD Cessna 0-2A Military\nfsd-international.com/projects/C02A.htm\n\nPlz share, thank you!\n\n\nGreetings to:\n\nFSSR group, keyno, popart, maximus, luke, rodger, phbfo, winnixl, and all other guys i forgot.\n\nAll the much unknown guys who shared over the emule network, too.\n\n\nNo greetings to:\n\n&quot;darth_tater&quot; -&gt; please don&amp;#039;t download my files!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e55b74f60a3dff18c0d35bffe69fc8a636753b","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+SystemboosterXP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e55b74f60a3dff18c0d35bffe69fc8a636753b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,229,91,116,246,10,61,255,24,192,211,91,255,230,159,200,166,54,117,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
