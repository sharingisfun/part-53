No real word from the bizkit for a long time. So whats new you say? A track from their upcomming Greatest Hitz has been leaked. This is what's is supposed to bring them back in the light of fame. Not the best they've done. Sadly, most would say it belongs in the same box as Behind Blue Eyes. And even more sadly, it's true. It does kindda grow on you after a few listens, but im really gettin impatient for the hard and rockin Bizkit once where. Enough of all the crappin around. \n\nGet on the road and lets hear the truth!!\n\n~kaw\n\n\nextra: Wes' &quot;solo&quot;-record, that has now turned into a actually band, called Black Light Burns, is also supposed to Hit the stores and streets sometime. The record should get here in the first quarter of 2006, and the live-band is still in progress...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f78f0da4d8806b33f03079ee27a7cef8fbd0725","amp;dn":"Limp+Bizkit+-+Bittersweet+Home+%28Leaked+2005-10-07%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f78f0da4d8806b33f03079ee27a7cef8fbd0725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,120,240,218,77,136,6,179,63,3,7,158,226,122,124,239,143,189,7,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
