The years go so fast, even for Harry Potter, who in the next movie will move to Madagascar, join WWE and be a full-time-wrestler. And that is the island of king kong. King kong is held in a prison and the natives pray that there won&amp;#039;t be a prison break. If there is, they will face their doom. A family who never was on madagascar was the simpsons. I think they went to brokeback mountain this season. You know that futurama has the same creator, matt groening. and FAMILY GAY can go and stick his american fag in the ass!!! 9 flashbacks every episode and just simpsonripoffs ALL THE TIME. In the age of empires charlie never saw the lord of the rings, or lotr. joey is a sad thing, wish it could be just &quot; friends &quot; . zorro makes a comeback but he will never be as popular as star wars or OC. In the south park in my town, there are a lot of pet shop boys yelling &quot;ADOBE&quot;, so the CSI is running around. I have a friend, alias, no... elias.
