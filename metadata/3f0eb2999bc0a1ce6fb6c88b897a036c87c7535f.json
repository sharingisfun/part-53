Initially i had a lot of random ideas, some which have been used in the avi and for the most part not entirely original but ive tried to keep some freshness to the things i've done. \n\nA Very big thank you goes to Mirvin_Monkey for taking the time to make an awesome plugin which can be obtained from www.madeabouthats.org/projects/mdt . Without that i wouldnt of been able to do over half of whats in the avi. I had actually wanted to use some its features more than i have, taking the idea from how quake3 can seperate the players from the map and then record a camera path for each so that they can be edited seamlessly together. As the camera path thing wasnt really plausible for tfc it ended up either being static cameras or 3rd person so i couldnt really achieve what i had wanted regarding displaying players and maps footage all in one big scene.\n\nThanks for waiting &quot;patiently&quot;, i got there in the end!\n\n_____________________\nUploaded by Led\n_____________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f0eb2999bc0a1ce6fb6c88b897a036c87c7535f","amp;dn":"ECTFC7_avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f0eb2999bc0a1ce6fb6c88b897a036c87c7535f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,14,178,153,155,192,161,206,111,182,200,139,137,122,3,108,135,199,83,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
