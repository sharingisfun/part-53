The movies are number one and three in The Vampire Chronicles, and this is number two, where you'll get to learn Lestat. Where was he born, how did he grow up, how did he become a vampire and more.\n\nWith 358 pages in full color, you will have something to read during those slow x-mas days ;)\n\nRead with CDisplay or open with WinRAR (or similiar program) and unzip the pictures to a folder for viewing.\n\nDon't be selfish and stop seeding once you've got the file, I can't seed this forever with my limited bandwidth of ~40 kb/s! Also, if you like it, a comment is always welcome.\n\nMerry X-Mas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8fb57372bf250af8af58866326498819e5d3902","amp;dn":"Anne+Rice+-+The+Vampire+Lestat+%C3%82%C2%A9+1991+Innovation.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8fb57372bf250af8af58866326498819e5d3902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,251,87,55,43,242,80,175,138,245,136,102,50,100,152,129,158,93,57,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
