Federation pilots have failed to dislodge the main plasma beastie and it's down to you to reinforce the first wave of troopers who are already on the ground. You've got one giant search and destroy mission ahead of you, so assault to the summit and get medieval on that plasma bug's mandibles. The fleet's future is in your hand, Marauder!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bee1533930ec5341f3b4a638681a5da05c71625","amp;dn":"DEMO+-+Starship+Troopers+Plasma+Mountain+demo+NEW%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bee1533930ec5341f3b4a638681a5da05c71625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,238,21,51,147,14,197,52,31,59,74,99,134,129,165,218,5,199,22,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
