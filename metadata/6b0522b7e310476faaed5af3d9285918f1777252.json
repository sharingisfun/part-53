There are no actors. This is your brain... on trance. Paul Oakenfold's 2001 album of Goa trance remixes has been transformed into a multidimensional experience. (The liner notes define &quot;Goa trance&quot; as &quot;a fusion of acid trance and tribal beats.&quot;) Ten London-based musicians, including Man With No Name and the Infinity Project, provide the pulsating soundtrack, while artist Yo Suzuki provides the 3-D visuals (don't worry--glasses are included). Over the course of 12 selections, vibrant abstract shapes &quot;dance&quot; to the beat as sampled voices occasionally jump into the fray. That's about it. If you were fascinated by kaleidoscopes as a child, laser shows as a teen, and 2001: A Space Odyssey as an adult, this DVD is for you. While there is little (obvious) variation between tracks, trance isn't about jarring juxtapositions and A Voyage Into Trance is one smooth audiovisual ride.\n--Kathleen C.
