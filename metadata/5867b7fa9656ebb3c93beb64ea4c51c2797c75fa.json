If you play this game BUY it!\n\n\n    Game Notes:\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~\n    Juiced is a racing simulation that totally immerses players in the \n    lifestyle, community and risk-taking of the real-life street modding\n    scene in a unique and compelling way. Juiced doesn&amp;#039;t pay lip-service to \n    the modding scene, it takes players there and immerses them in the \n    culture - racing for pink slips, creating crews and providing the \n    complete freedom to customize cars - from the dashboard to the \n    drivetrain. Featuring over 50 licensed cars, 200 official aftermarket \n    parts, and incredible online head-to-head play for up to 6 players and \n    team-based racing; Juiced is one of this year&amp;#039;s most anticipated racing \n    titles.\n    \n    Ripped:\n    ~~~~~~~\n    Music, movies\n\n    \n    Release Note:\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    What?s this? MYTH has PROPERED it&amp;#039;s own rip? What madness.\n    Yes that&amp;#039;s correct! We have indeed PROPERED ourselves.\n\n    Why?\n    In the interests of maintaining rip scene standards we chose to proper\n    ourselves and keep the rips nice and small as they should be.\n\n    Many times groups past, present and for sure in the future have cried\n    fowl when MYTH has propered them. Well now they no longer have a case\n    that we are picking on them. As of today we have PROVEN that we are\n    dedicated to making the best rips possible for the end users. No\n    matter who we make look lame for our dedication to quality rips.\n\n    Also in the past many have said the RIP scene is dead, due to the\n    craving for iSO. Well while some users can experience 1GB links in\n    the home, they are still shackled by traffic byte limits. Therefore\n    no matter how fast the link is, if it has traffic limits you could\n    use all your metered traffic up with one DVD9 release!\n\n    Thus the future of rip is in limiting how much traffic you incur,\n    whilst still maintaining the quality of the warez you wish to obtain.\n    Here on the GAME RIP scene, is where MYTH comes in of course!\n\n    Recently we have seen the advent of DVD and DVD9 formats. And MYTH\n    has ripped games from these formats, as is to be expected. With\n    removable storage media becoming so cheap you can carry your MYTH\n    rips with you on your keychain these days! This is another advantage\n    of using quality rips and there are many more, such as faster load\n    times and so on.\n\n    Thus RIP is not dead and never will be. Expect MYTH to rip 20GB DVD&amp;#039;s\n    down in the future and beyond.\n\n    So, while we have RETIRED of the lesson dealings to the CLASS, we\n    shall always make sure that MYTH brings you the latest and best GAME\n    RIPS in the scene by keeping the rip scene alive along with all the\n    other elites.\n\n    Signed: MYTH\n\n\n\n    Read this NFO properly!\n\n                                      ÃƒÅ¸\n                                      ?
