It is the story of men and women around the world who resist being annihilated in this war. \n\nWhile our airwaves are crowded with talk of a new world war, narrated by generals and filmed from the noses of bombs, the human story of this global conflict remains untold. &amp;quot;The Fourth World War&amp;quot; brings together the images and voices of the war on the ground. It is a story of a war without end and of those who resist. \nThe product of over two years of filming on the inside of movements on five continents, &amp;quot;The Fourth World War&amp;quot; is a film that would have been unimaginable at any other moment in history. Directed by the makers of &amp;quot;This Is What Democracy Looks Like&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Zapatista&amp;quot;, produced through a global network of independent media and activist groups, it is a truly global film from our global movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b5095630c55c9813eccb20f3f7760b2ca46d1c","amp;dn":"The+fourth+World+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b5095630c55c9813eccb20f3f7760b2ca46d1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,181,9,86,48,197,92,152,19,236,203,32,243,247,118,11,44,164,109,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
