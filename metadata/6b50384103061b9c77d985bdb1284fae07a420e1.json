It has all ingredients you&amp;#039;re \n looking for. Lots of keyboards sweaping around, great edgy \n guitar-fills and best of all, wonderful drumming from Jonas ThurÃƒÂ©n!\n This Swedish band&amp;#039;s one of the most interesting this year. \n I&amp;#039;m already longing for their follow up...\n &quot;LEVEL 11&quot; Teddy Jonasson\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------\n Question: Name a Swedish band that has signed a deal with a Canadian \n record label? Answer: Xinema... a progressive rock band, consisting \n of 3 experienced musicians, who already played together in the band \n Madrigal during the second half of the 80?s. \n Back then their music was inspired by the likes of Genesis, Kansas, \n Rush, Styx and Yes, nowadays they produce a perfect mix of progressive \n and melodic rock. We here at Rock Report cover both styles with a lot \n of enthusiasm and I?m sure the music of this 3-piece must be able to \n catch on a lot of you. The compositions are well thought-out and the \n performances of Mikael Askemur (lv, b, k, g, pr), Sven Larsson (lg, bv) \n and Jonas ThurÃƒÂ©n (d, lv, bv) are well-finished as well. \n\n Add to that a good production and a brilliant cover and you have an album, \n which will grow into a collector?s item in the years to come. \n\n Don?t let this jewel slip away! *****\n (review by CL - added on 18/02/2003)\n &quot;ROCK REPORT&quot;\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n /ELQ\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b50384103061b9c77d985bdb1284fae07a420e1","amp;dn":"Xinema+-+Different+ways+%28Progressive+Rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b50384103061b9c77d985bdb1284fae07a420e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,80,56,65,3,6,27,156,119,217,133,189,177,40,79,174,7,164,32,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
