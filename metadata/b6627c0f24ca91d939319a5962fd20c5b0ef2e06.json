And it is perhaps the best comedy which ever was made in Germany. There are many jokes and funny scenes in this movie. For example &quot;Pfeiffer&quot; with three &quot;f&quot; one before the &quot;ei&quot; (or in English &quot;egg&quot;) and two after the &quot;ei&quot;. The entire cast is top notch. Heinz Ruehmann is one of my favorite actors. And one of his films &quot;The Captain of Koepenick&quot; received an Oscar nomination.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6627c0f24ca91d939319a5962fd20c5b0ef2e06","amp;dn":"Die_Feuerzangenbowle_%28German%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6627c0f24ca91d939319a5962fd20c5b0ef2e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,98,124,15,36,202,145,217,57,49,154,89,98,253,32,197,176,239,46,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
