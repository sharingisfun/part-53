The wolf lives in the woods and is also lonely because her male partner has been shot. The relation between Kim Jansson and the female wolf is very well filmed and the camera often zooms in on Kim's face and particular her beautiful eyes. The film shows good and evil. Kim and some of her friends are the good ones, helping the wolves. The male hunters are the bad ones, shooting animals for money. After the wolf saves Kim, when she is lost in the woods, she visits the wolf once more to detect that she has two puppies. The hunters eventually kill the female wolf. Kim tries to save the puppies of the wolf and delivers them to ...... another wolf. This is a weak part, because that is not quite realistic. It may be also fiction here. The good thing of this film is that it shows the intrinsic warm love for nature of men. \nSwedish film (no subs exept norwegian)\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342777","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a182ba84dbeb701263643ded62ee0af6f584e2b","amp;dn":"Misa+mi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a182ba84dbeb701263643ded62ee0af6f584e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,24,43,168,77,190,183,1,38,54,67,222,214,46,224,175,111,88,78,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
