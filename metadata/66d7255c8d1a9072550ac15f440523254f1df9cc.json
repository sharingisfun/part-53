But when an early bid for revenge is foiled, he flees to the East for counsel from the mystifying Ra's Al-Ghul (Watanabe). Fit for a return to the decaying Gotham City, Wayne heads underground with Lucius Fox (Freeman), an old family ally who helps him embrace his new persona: Batman. With a detective's intuition and a millionaire's resources, the master crime-fighter squares off against two of Gotham's biggest threats, unaware that a sinister, knowing enemy plots against him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d7255c8d1a9072550ac15f440523254f1df9cc","amp;dn":"Batman.Begins.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d7255c8d1a9072550ac15f440523254f1df9cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,215,37,92,141,26,144,114,85,10,193,95,68,5,35,37,79,29,249,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
