Wood discussed several cases from his book Majic Eyes Only, a comprehensive investigation into 74 UFO crash incidents and subsequent military retrievals/cover-ups, based on evidence found in newspaper articles, eyewitness reports, and leaked Majestic documents.\n\nThe earliest UFO case Wood chronicles in his book took place in Aurora, Texas in 1897. According to witnesses, a mysterious silver cigar-shaped object struck a windmill, scattering debris and killing the craft&amp;#039;s extraterrestrial pilot. A newspaper of the time reported that the pilot&amp;#039;s body was buried in a local cemetery.\n\nWood also touched on UFO incidents in Roswell, Braxton County, Shag Harbor, as well as the events surrounding the Los Angeles Air Raid, in which a UFO flying over L.A. caused the military to launch an anti-aircraft barrage. He said General George Marshall founded the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (or IPU) shortly after this incident. In all these cases, Wood said it is clear that something crashed and was taken away or covered up by the government.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                               \n  \n=-=\n\n|| [outdated] C2C List: http://utopiated.net/docs/c2c-compiled-list-htm.html  ||  Archived and seeded by davID@!UtopiAted!Net!   ||","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd04054cda3f3c4537696cd8bf218ad75cc6171","amp;dn":"Majic-Eyes-Only-UFO-Crashes-Coast2Coast-Jan19-2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd04054cda3f3c4537696cd8bf218ad75cc6171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,208,64,84,205,163,243,196,83,118,150,205,139,242,24,173,117,204,97,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
