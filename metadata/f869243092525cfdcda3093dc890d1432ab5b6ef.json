The 11 song LP features eight original compositions by &quot;The Maverick of the Blues&quot;, Wild Child Butler. \nWild Child Butler was born in Autaugaville, Alabama in 1936. Wild Child made a name for himself in the 50&amp;#039;s and early 60&amp;#039;s playing in Chicago and the rural juke joints in Alabama. He first recorded in 1964 and then hooked up with the legendary Willie Dixon who produced four Wild Child singles for Jewel Records from 1966 to 1968. Those sessions were highlighted by the dual harp numbers featuring Wild Child and the great Big Walter Horton. \n\nWild Child Butler&amp;#039;s resume is top notch. He has toured with Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin&amp;#039; Hopkins, Cousin Joe and Roosevelt Sykes. His last two recordings were released in the &amp;#039;90s on Rounder Records. Wild Child&amp;#039;s biggest influence is Sonny Boy Williamson II and yet his sound is all his own. A prolific songwriter, Wild Child Butler performs mostly his own compositions. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f869243092525cfdcda3093dc890d1432ab5b6ef","amp;dn":"Wild+Child+Butler-Lickin+gravy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f869243092525cfdcda3093dc890d1432ab5b6ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,105,36,48,146,82,92,253,205,163,9,61,200,144,209,67,42,181,182,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
