I&amp;#039;m not offended or anything but still it was sort of surprising to hear &quot;HE&amp;#039;S TAKING A SHIT!!&quot; within the first few minutes of the interview.\n\nLineage: JVC L-A55 (turntable) &gt; Yamaha Stereo Amplifier CR-220 &gt; Phones jack (mono) &gt; M-Audio FastTrack USB &gt; Roxio CD Spin Doctor &gt; Sound Studio 2.1.1 beta 3 (clean up and editing out silence) &gt; xACT 1.5 beta 4 &gt; YOU, FINALLY\n\nI could not get the RCA output on my amplifier working so since the record sounded like it was recorded in mono I just ran the output throught the phones jack and into my USB interface. The recording is very clear and I doubt any loss in quality as the quality of the record was very poor to begin with.\n\nTracklisting\n------------\n1. Side 1 (9:42)\n2. Side 2 (10:25)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dad8cde3edc523b2fe81c1560099ca17860adaa","amp;dn":"Fat+Boys%3A+Interview+Picture+Disc+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dad8cde3edc523b2fe81c1560099ca17860adaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,173,140,222,62,220,82,59,47,232,28,21,96,9,156,161,120,96,173,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
