He maintains that colonizing the moon has the potential to mitigate these problems. \n\n&quot;We've got to find alternate forms of energy,&quot; Proser stated, explaining that all of our earthly resources combined will not be able to provide for the world's energy needs in 50 years. According to Proser, a viable and abundant energy source awaits us on the moon in the form of helium-3. Proser said moon dust, which contains helium-3, could be refined on the moon and brought back to power fusion reactors on Earth. He estimates it would take only 25 tons (one space shuttle full) of helium-3 to power the entire United States for one year. \n\nProser also envisioned living in lava domes under the surface of the moon, building lunar solar stations that could transmit &quot;clean&quot; power via microwave energy back to Earth, and using space elevators to place people and objects into space.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0812c8eb0618f03b52e4f4b8e32601dcf9fc2492","amp;dn":"Colonizing+the+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0812c8eb0618f03b52e4f4b8e32601dcf9fc2492","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,18,200,235,6,24,240,59,82,228,244,184,227,38,1,220,249,252,36,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
