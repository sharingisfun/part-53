In addition, O&amp;amp;O Defrag boasts a built-in software distributor \n(O&amp;amp;O ComponentInstaller) that makes the installation of software on client \ncomputers a matter of a few mouse clicks. Updates can also be easily \nintegrated into the network by way of an intelligent version monitoring \nsystem. \nIn terms of client software, O&amp;amp;O Defrag V8.0 Server Edition comes with its \nown O&amp;amp;O Defrag Agent that only needs to be installed once. After the Defrag \nAgent is installed, all communication with the console will be \nautomatically managed. This means that as soon as a new computer is added \nto the network, or the console detects a computer running without an agent \ninstalled, the administrator will be given that choice to install that \nagent. No additional settings or installations are necessary. All actions \nare taken automatically and without any risk to the security of Windows. \n\n\nUnpack and install, Use our keymaker to register it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1270b284c9248c22d251171167d2ec3d19ae8c89","amp;dn":"OO+Defrag+Server+Edition+v8+0+Incl+Keymaker-ZWT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1270b284c9248c22d251171167d2ec3d19ae8c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,112,178,132,201,36,140,34,210,81,23,17,103,210,236,61,25,174,140,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
