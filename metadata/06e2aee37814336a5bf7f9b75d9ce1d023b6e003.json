P R E S E N T S . . .\n\nTBS has a commercial at the very start of their release\nwhich we wouldn't really care about... no big fucking\ndeal but their source is NOT the DSR it was labeled as.\n\nCheck the screenshots which include the frame number\neach were captured from.  As an added bonus you can\nplay along at home, all you need to download is their\nsample, cut off the commercial at the start and\nyou're ready to go.\n\nWe did get their whole release, and we did see the blocky\nscenes throughout as shown in our screenshots.\n\nThis isn't qualitative, this is the same as someone\nreleasing something as HDTV which obviously is not.\n \n . . .
