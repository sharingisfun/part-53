There&amp;#039;s also a tiny bit of stuff off of the original win98 disk too. These are all video promos - and a few of them you would possibly have seen on your TV way back in 1996. Nostaligic nonsense. I love old TV myself...I personally like the old Charlie Says videos. If any one has any of them to share please let me know...........CHARLIE SAYS DON&amp;#039;T PLAY WITH MATCHES MEEEEEOWWWWWWWWWWW!
