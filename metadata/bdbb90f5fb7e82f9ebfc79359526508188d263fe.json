Based in Orange County, the band stuck strongly to their roots, and adopted a feisty &quot;no sell out&quot; stance which stood them in good stead with the legions of hardcore punk fans who flocked to them. This reunion concert captures all the energy and enthusiasm of the band, as well as delivering an awesome selection of their best material.\n\nThis is a great DVD from a great band, I used dvd-shrink to encode the main show (didn't bother to include the extras) and compressed it down to 1.6gb.\n\nNo Way   (NOFX did a cover of this on the May 7Inch of the month club)\nWho Is Who\nSelf Destruct\nDemocracy  \nO.C.
