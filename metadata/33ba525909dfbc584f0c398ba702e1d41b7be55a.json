In order to control her social behaviour, the young man, rich enough not having to work for a living (but indefinitely planning to write a novel) virtually locks her up in his flat and monitors her moves, behaviour and social calls.\n\nHe is very jealous and suspicious in general, but what really throws him into a fit of paranoia and obsessive behaviour is when he starts suspecting that she is really a lesbian, and that she sees girls when he doesn't know about it. After all, other men he can compete with, he sort of knows that kind of game; but he knows he would never be able to compete with women because with them, he's really out of the competition. This situation causes both of them much distress.\n\nWhen I saw this film I first felt that it was a little boring and flat but it grew a lot after a while and afterwards I knew I'd watch it several times more. You can enrich yourselves a lot if you give the novel a go, but you can't skip to the fifth part of the novel just to read the original story behind this film; one has to start from page one, or it probably won't be very meaningful.\n\nNOTE: With this film I had to omit the menu/scene selection page, or else the copying software wouldn't have managed to copy the disc to HDD due to some fault. Therefore, there is no menu page included here (and no &quot;FBI Warning&quot; types of warning pages or similar adverts).\n\nANOTHER NOTE: This torrent I'm afraid I'm going to have to seed in portions, shutting down the computer when I'm at school. See it from the bright side :-) Those with slow lines will catch up better (if there is anybody who want this).\n\nUncompressed dvd PAL\nSpoken language: French / Francais\nSubtitles: English\n1.85:1\nDolby Digital 2.0\ncover included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ba525909dfbc584f0c398ba702e1d41b7be55a","amp;dn":"The+Captive+%28La+Captive%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ba525909dfbc584f0c398ba702e1d41b7be55a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,186,82,89,9,223,188,88,79,12,57,139,167,2,225,212,27,123,229,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
