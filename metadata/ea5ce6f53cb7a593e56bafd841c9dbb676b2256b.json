After robbing their teacher on their last day at school, Ryoko gets a job in a hair salon, while the two boys settle down to a career of enforcement and protection. \nSet in Kishiwada, a fishing district in the industrial town of Osaka, Innocent Blood lives up to its title. A lot of blood gets splattered around without anyone getting too badly hurt or taking too much offence. This is a story of rough kids trying to find their way in the world, a world of violence, sentiment and comedy, in a film that moves at a cracking pace from the opening shot.\nASIANTORRENTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5ce6f53cb7a593e56bafd841c9dbb676b2256b","amp;dn":"Young+Thugs+innocent+blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5ce6f53cb7a593e56bafd841c9dbb676b2256b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,92,230,245,60,183,165,147,229,107,175,216,65,201,219,182,118,178,37,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
