(You can also dig it up on the Torrent Sites\nif you swing that way.) Just install and register it, and then open\n'VIDEO_TS.IFO' to start the DVD.\n\nGREAT - VLC Media Player. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/\n\nIt's really nice too and it's freeware. A must have if your broke but not\nmorally bankrupt too. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.\n\nJust unzip the files and run vlc.exe. In VCL, Choose File -&gt; Open Directory\nand Browse to the VIDEO_TS folder. Once the game is started, choose Video -&gt;\nDeinterlace -&gt; Blend to eliminate any horizontal line 'artifacts' you might see.\n\nOK - Media Player Classic. http://sourceforge.net/project/showf...ckage_id=84358\n\nAnother Freeware Player. It's ultra fast and small and makes a nice\nalternative to Windows Media Player. It does have built-in DVD support\n(File -&gt; Open DVD), but I just prefer PowerDVD or VLC Player for DVDs.\n\nDecent - Windows Media Player. http://already.installed.on.your.computer.bloatware\n\nFree and does a decent job with DVDs. The video looks significantly worse on \nboth my computers using Windows Media Player 10. It's justreally big and clunky\n and slow. You can buy DVD plug-ins for it but you might as well buy WinDVD if \nyou're going to crack open your wallet...\n\n\nHow to Play this DVD on your DVD Player:\n1) Verify that your DVD Player supports 480x480 format. Generally speaking,\nany DVD player that supports VCD or SVCD will work. Some DVD players\n(especially newer or fancier ones) will also handle this. Your DVD player\nmust also support DVDR DVDs, of course.\n\nThere's an unofficial list here:\nhttp://www.dealdatabase.com/forum/sh...9&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15\n\n2) Burn the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders onto the root of the DVDR using\nyour favorite burning software. Most people seem to prefer Nero, but there\nare free programs out there too like CDBurnerXP Pro. Here's a guide for\nburning with Nero: http://www.digitalfaq.com/dvdguides/...vd/nerodvd.htm\n\nWhat to do if your DVD Player can't Play the DVD:\n1) Consider purchasing a new DVD player that specifically supports\n480x480 format.\n\n2) Hang onto the DVD - Someday you'll have to get a new DVD player, right?\n\n3) Reauthor it. You'll have to reencode it to 720x480 which will\nmake the size go up and/or the quality go down. The video files are the\nsame source files I'm working with.\n\n4) Play the DVD on your computer.\n\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the fifth collector DVD of the 2005 series.  I will be releasing these \nprofessional quality DVDs for all the Buckeye games from now on.  The quality\nof the video is identical to the DirecTV digital broadcast, so you won't find\nbetter quality and compression anywhere.\n\nI have about 50KB of bandwidth that I'm going to try to keep a seed available at \nall times.  With 12 games on the schedule - including the Fiesta Bowl :) - I really\nneed people to be good about seeding for a REALLY LONG time or else I'll be \nuploading the Fiesta Bowl DVD @ 4KB/sec.  (2KB/sec when we win back to back MNCs)\n\nWant to get involved?  I'm always looking for good highlight videos.  If you want\nto make them for the DVD, just PM me and I'll provide my some of my video files \nahead of time.  I'd love to have 1-3 per DVD :)\n\n\nSeed Seed Seed!  Please try to seed at least 200% - it's the only way this \nproject will work.\n\n\n\nFor more Buckeye goodness, visit www.BuckeyePlanet.com, the ultimate Buckeye Fan Community!\n\nSpecial Thanks go to:\nClarity for making the best damn fan website in the land (http://www.buckeyeplanet.com)\nGAB189 for making the Penn State Highlight Video\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b37a23ce6d07c4ed69f9a7b1c7f589617c342c3","amp;dn":"2005+Game5+OhioStateAtPennState+DVD+TimBUCK2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b37a23ce6d07c4ed69f9a7b1c7f589617c342c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,55,162,60,230,208,124,78,214,159,154,123,28,127,88,150,23,195,66,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
