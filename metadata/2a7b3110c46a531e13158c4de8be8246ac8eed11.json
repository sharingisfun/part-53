Styling and staging gets underway and the band give their first interview to a national radio station. But their performance fails to impress Gene and, as soon as they have left the station, an argument breaks out between him and the children which finishes with them telling him to go home. The non-band members accompany Gene to a red carpet event, and the band record their first single in a studio.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7b3110c46a531e13158c4de8be8246ac8eed11","amp;dn":"Gene+Simmons+Rock+School+-+S01E05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a7b3110c46a531e13158c4de8be8246ac8eed11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,123,49,16,196,106,83,30,19,21,140,77,232,190,130,70,172,142,237,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
