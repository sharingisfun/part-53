Strange Locomotion/I'm All Aching\t(Dandelion DAN 7002)\t1971\t\n  \n\nFormed in Bradford in the late sixties they moved to London and signed for John Peel's Dandelion label. Mick Gratton replaced Chichester on lead guitar for the second album, but soon afterwards the group disintegrated. Coyne made a further album for Dandelion, Case History, and later a series of albums for Virgin, which did not attract the attention they deserved. Many of Coyne's recordings were influenced by his experiences as a social therapist in a Preston psychiatric hospital and later, upon his move to London, as a social worker in Camden. Despite plugs by John Peel, neither Siren or Coyne's solo recordings sold well, although most are now sought-after by record collectors. They also recorded two 45s as Clague. \n\nFetch Me My Woman and The War Is Over appear on Dandelion Rarities (CD), and Strange Locomotion is included on the Dandelion Sampler 1969-1972 CD.\n\n[IMG]http://img83.imageshack.us/img83/262/cd13kn.jpg[/IMG]\nArtist     : Siren\nAlbum      : Siren\nYear       : 1969\n\nTrack Listing\n-------------\n 1.
