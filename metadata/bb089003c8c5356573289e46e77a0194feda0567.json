On versions lower than XP the patched executable displays the error &quot;procedure entry point restorelasterror could not be located in the dynamic link library kernel32.dll&quot;. This is because this function doesn't exist on Win2K installations. But this executable is fixed after patching and works fine on my Win2KSP4 w/final rollups.\n\nThe problem and solution to the problem - which manifests itself with several patcher programs and unpackers - is described here : http://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=2618&amp;goto=nextoldest\n\nWell, enjoy this torrent fix, or maybe you can apply the fix yourselves if you want.
