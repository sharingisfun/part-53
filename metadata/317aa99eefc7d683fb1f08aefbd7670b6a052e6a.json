The second album of the pop duo is expected to be in the spotlight. While higher expectation is placed over the duo, they also challenge themselves to reach a more sophisticated sound in their latest offering. Title song Sky is a ballad while rock tune Blue 923 offers a powerful modern melody. Also check out sweet and mellow tunes like Kiss Me, Hold Me and Like a Fairy Tale (track 7), and a cool song with a bossa nova taste My Dear.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:317aa99eefc7d683fb1f08aefbd7670b6a052e6a","amp;dn":"Loveholic+-+%2802%29+Invisible+things+%28Kpop%2FKrock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"317aa99eefc7d683fb1f08aefbd7670b6a052e6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,122,169,158,239,199,214,131,251,31,8,174,251,215,103,11,106,5,46,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
