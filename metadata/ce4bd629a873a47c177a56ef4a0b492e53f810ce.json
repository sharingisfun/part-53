After the series was broadcast in 1969, 1973, 1976, 1979 and 1985, the show was banned by NRK (Norwegian National Broadcasting) as it was deemed too dangerous for children. After this a huge cult-following grew, demanding to get &quot;Pompel og Pilt&quot; back on television and today the characters are considered one of the greatest pop-cultural icons in Norwegian television-history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4bd629a873a47c177a56ef4a0b492e53f810ce","amp;dn":"Pompel+%26.Pilt+Norwegian+Children+TV+70%60s.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce4bd629a873a47c177a56ef4a0b492e53f810ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,75,214,41,168,115,164,124,23,122,86,239,74,11,73,46,83,248,16,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
