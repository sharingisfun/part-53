The killers shoot Castle himself in the chest, but he inexplicably survives and--as any moviegoer expects--sets out to even the score. Implausibly, given his sometimes curious and roundabout methods, he succeeds. Also featuring Will Patton (Armageddon) as an oily thug, Laura Harring (Mulholland Drive) as Saint's fleshpot wife, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (X-Men) as a waitress with bad taste in men","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f12143d61fa10a04946fd92c7f85ed5333f1dc","amp;dn":"The+Punisher+DVD-rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f12143d61fa10a04946fd92c7f85ed5333f1dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,241,33,67,214,31,161,10,4,148,111,217,44,127,133,237,83,51,241,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
