Van Helsing (Casper Van Dien) and Mina (Alexandra Kamp-Groeneveld) are part of an interstellar salvage crew who come across the husk of the ship Demeter, which has been missing for 100 years. Initially thrilled by the prospect of the fortune this find will bring them, the crew boards the Demeter in order to assess the ship and take possession of any valuables left behind. Once there, however, they discover the abandoned ship's terrifying cargo, but accidentally let lose the ancient evil that has been sleeping for a century. In the outer reaches of space, the vampire lives in constant darkness with no threat of sunlight; the crew thus begins a desperate race to reach the light of the Twin Suns of Halbron before none of them are left alive. Coolio also stars as 187, and horror cult icon Udo Kier makes a special appearance\n\nwww.pctorrent.com !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37692c98a2c2b5e6352f721b549329fdd7d57851","amp;dn":"Dracula+3000+%5B2005%5D%5BDVDScreener%5D%5BEnglish+Subs+Esp%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37692c98a2c2b5e6352f721b549329fdd7d57851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,105,44,152,162,194,181,230,53,47,114,27,84,147,41,253,215,213,120,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
