Their project was to make 7 albums in 7 years with 7 tracks on each CDs... They did it in 1997 with their 7th album; Paradise... Then the band split... But the leader relaunched the band in 2000, and it is still active nowadays.\n\nI think G.O.D. is one of the finest gothic band around (even if I'm not really a fan of the goth scene). They are almost unknown where I live, and I had to order their cds from the internet since they couldn't be found in my area! I don't know if they are more popular in other countries, but they would deserve it I.M.H.O.\n\nDon't forget to seed... you can also upload the torrent on other trackers if you want!\n\nAnd if you like the band, I suggest you buy their CDs...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7816559d4b148f25e52915053c612ea99e17c24b","amp;dn":"Garden+Of+Delight+-+50+Songs+%5BGothic+-+MP3+-+96+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7816559d4b148f25e52915053c612ea99e17c24b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,22,85,157,75,20,143,37,229,41,21,5,60,97,46,169,158,23,194,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
