NOTHING ELSE has been edited or removed or anything.\n\nSubs: English, English (hearing impaired), Spanish. Italian, Islenska\nLang: English (original, 5.1), Italian, Spanish\n\nIf you have ever download a file i have uploaded, you will know that that&amp;#039;s how i work... Either upload full DVD rip, or nothing.\n\nThis seed is H-U-G-E (more than 40GBs) so be patient. Don&amp;#039;t start complaining it takes too long. I seed it, i know that.\n\nPlease, seed all the time, even if you haven&amp;#039;t download everything... That way, i don&amp;#039;t have to seed parts i have already uploaded. Plain and simple.\n\nFor the first time (sorry for that, but well that&amp;#039;s good at least for this torrent) i will use DHT network. Use it to. Download the latest version of your Torrent manager, i use bitcomet 0.62, very good one, and i recommend it. if you have another, NO PROBLEM, just seed.\n\nAlso for the first time, i use .sfv files in each Dir of the DVDs, for file verification. delete them before burning the files to dvds :D\n\nLast but (certainly) not least, SEED. I will seed this to the end. Just as i did with Transformers, i will seed all the time, until 5 of you have the 100% of the file.\n\nTrackers i will use are thepiratebay.se, torrentbox.com, torrentspy.com, and isohunt. MOST IMPORTANT &quot;TRACKER&quot; for me will be DHT which is stable etc.\n\n\nSeed!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://play.com/play247.asp?pa=srmr&amp;page=title&amp;r=R2&amp;title=860274&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://play.com/play247.asp?pa=srmr&amp;page=title&amp;r=R2&amp;title=860274&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1.

If you want to contact me mail me at &quot;kinowi at gmail dot com&quot; with subject &quot;Pirate&quot; or else i wont receive your mail due to spam filters.\n\nNext Project: Transformers Full DVD Rip - 1st Year (3dvds)\nPs: Transformers project has been seeded in the past (1st DVD) only, at ?id=3370760? in thepiratebay.se. That seed is not supported by me (after a long seeding period).\n\nYou have to delete this file(s) after previewing them. You are not allowed to keep them, or copy them, or burn them for anything more than preview.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d12a8760d59d18a84c1faa4997e497e55259b9a6","amp;dn":"LOST+-+TV+Series+-+1st+Year+-+FULL+DVD+RIPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d12a8760d59d18a84c1faa4997e497e55259b9a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,42,135,96,213,157,24,168,76,31,170,73,151,228,151,229,82,89,185,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
