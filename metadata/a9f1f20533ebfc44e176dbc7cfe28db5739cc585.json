On the eve of a historic reunification of North and South Korea, a ruthless general stages a military coup to take control of North Korea and threatens the world with nuclear war. The international community launches a global task force to stabilize the region. However, when diplomatic efforts collapse and the region descends into anarchy they announce a one hundred million dollar bounty on the North Korean general and his top military and scientific advisors. The targets are identified in a &amp;quot;most wanted&amp;quot; list in the form of a 52-card deck of playing cards. As one of the top operatives for a private mercenaries company called Executive Operations, you have been called in to collect on these bounties.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9f1f20533ebfc44e176dbc7cfe28db5739cc585","amp;dn":"Mercenaries+-+Xbox+USA+Full+DVD+-+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9f1f20533ebfc44e176dbc7cfe28db5739cc585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,241,242,5,51,235,252,68,225,118,219,199,207,226,141,181,115,156,197,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
