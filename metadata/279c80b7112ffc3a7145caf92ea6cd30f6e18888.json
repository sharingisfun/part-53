We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. A lot of crazy stuff happens, for example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279c80b7112ffc3a7145caf92ea6cd30f6e18888","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t+be+a+menace+%2B+NLsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279c80b7112ffc3a7145caf92ea6cd30f6e18888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,156,128,183,17,47,252,58,113,69,202,249,46,166,205,48,246,225,136,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
