I have not re-encoded it -- it is totally untouched.  The up side is that you get to choose whether or not to re-encode, and if so, what software to use.  The down side is that you can't just go ahead and burn to single layer DVD.  I chose this because I only have dvd2one, and I think most people prefer to have stuff encoded with CCE.  Besides, this is a _small_ DVD-9 :)\n\nThis is my first time posting anything -- please do not flame, instead just enjoy this great movie :)\n\n----\n\nThis is a very smart and thought-provoking film.\n\nLONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH !!!\n\n----\n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0086541/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66721a747133e2c667710e28587a29ffdd863d35","amp;dn":"Videodrome+%28DVD-9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66721a747133e2c667710e28587a29ffdd863d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,114,26,116,113,51,226,198,103,113,14,40,88,122,41,255,221,134,61,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
