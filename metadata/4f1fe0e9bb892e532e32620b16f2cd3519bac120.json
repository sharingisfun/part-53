Through a combination of shortwave radio broadcasts, widely distributed videotapes and personal appearances, the university maintenance worker has used his speaking skills to spread his message of &quot;New World Order&quot;. Koernke was one of the leaders in the birth and growth of the militia movement and achieved widespread attention after being &quot;mistakenly&quot; linked to the Oklahoma City bombing. Since then he has suffered numerous setbacks, including prison, but still maintains a loyal cadre of supporters. This is a lecture by Mark Koernke about the U.N take over of the U.S, gun control and concentration camps for U.S. citizens.\n\nVideo Codec: WMV9\nVideo: 512  kbit/s\nRuntime: 1 Hour 53 Min.\nAudio codec: WMA9\nAudio format: 48 kbps\nFrame Size: 320x240 \nRipper: Ctrl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f1fe0e9bb892e532e32620b16f2cd3519bac120","amp;dn":"America+in+Peril+%28U.N.+take+over+of+the+U.S.%29%28NWO%29+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f1fe0e9bb892e532e32620b16f2cd3519bac120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,31,224,233,187,137,46,83,46,50,98,11,22,242,205,53,25,186,193,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
