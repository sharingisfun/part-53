In short, the RainbowCrack tool \nis a hash cracker. A traditional brute force cracker try all possible \nplaintexts one by one in cracking time. It is time consuming to break \ncomplex password in this way. The idea of time-memory trade-off is to \ndo all cracking time computation in advance and store the result in \nfiles so called &quot;rainbow table&quot;. It does take a long time to precompute \nthe tables. But once the one time precomputation is finished, a time-\nmemory trade-off cracker can be hundreds of times faster than a brute \nforce cracker, with the help of precomputed tables.\n=======================================================================\n\nFastLM tables are an improvement on the original type of LM tables --&gt;\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/\n=======================================================================\nA new type of Rainbow Tables has been added to Winrtgen v1.3. &quot;FastLM&quot; \ntables can be used against LM Hashes and provide both faster generation \nand cryptanalysis. FastLM tables are not compatible with standard \ntables for LM Hashes generated by RainbowCrack, renaming the filenames \nis useless.\n=======================================================================\n\nThe full set of these &quot;Rainbow Tables&quot; will crack 99.99% of all alpha-\nnumeric (Windows NT) Lan-Manager password hashes.\n\nEach of the tables are in separate achieves, this means that you have \nto extract each of the tables individually. The reason I did it this \nway is so that people can download only some of the tables if they so \ndesire.\n\nSuccess probability of cracking a alpha-numeric Lan-Manager hash:\n1 Tables = 76.96%\n2 Tables = 94.69%\n3 Tables = 98.78%\n4 Tables = 99.72%\n5 Tables = 99.94%\n6 Tables = 99.99%\n\nThese tables can only be used in conjunction with Cain from \nhttp://www.oxid.it/cain.html\n\nTo crack passwords using FastLM tables and Cain:\n1. Open Cain\n2. Click the &quot;Cracker&quot; tab\n3. Select &quot;LM &amp; NTLM Hashes&quot; from the list on the left\n4. Add passwords to the list using the &quot;+&quot; button on the top toolbar\n5. Select accounts to attack\n6. Right click on the account/accounts and select &quot;Cryptanalysis Attack \n(FastLM)&quot;\n7. Press &quot;Add Table&quot; and select the rainbow tables\n8. Press &quot;Start&quot;\n\nThe tables are suitably sized to fit onto a DVD for portability. The \ntables can be used directly from the DVD.\n\nThe tool used to generate these tables - Winrtgen, is included with \nCain.\n\nTable properties -\nHash: fastlm\nMin Length: 1\nMax Length: 7\nIndex: 0-5\nChain Length: 3573\nChain Count: 48877622\nNumber of tables: 6\nCharacter set: alpha-numeric\nKey space: 80603140212\nDisk space: 4.36 GB (745.81 MB each table)\nSuccess probability: 0.999850 (99.99%)\n\nBenchmark (AMD Athlon 2600+) -\nHash speed: 3556187 hash/sec\nStep speed: 1495215 step/sec\nTable precomputation time: 1.35184 days\nTotal precomputation time: 8.11105 days\nMax cryptanalysis time: 25.6144 seconds\n\nBrought to you by Infirmus.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4d0005fe2aae16f9d5af0a575cbb411e6cf72c","amp;dn":"Rainbow+Tables+FastLM+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b4d0005fe2aae16f9d5af0a575cbb411e6cf72c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,77,0,5,254,42,174,22,249,213,175,10,87,92,187,65,30,108,247,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
