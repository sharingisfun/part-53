The film, produced this summer by al-Sahab, an al-Qaeda production company, is focused upon the preparation and subsequent execution of ?Operation: Crushing the Cross.? \n\nFootage of the mujahideen assembling missiles, attending training exercises and indoor briefings led by the command of the operation, and launching attacks, are intertwined with several speeches by members of the group, speaking in Arabic, English, French, and Urdu, providing justification for their jihad and spouting vitriol against Americans and Western nations. \n\nAn English speaker with an Australian accent, identified as ?Khalid al-Sheikh,? attacked both, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President George W. Bush as creating the illusion of free nations, and making their populous as slaves to their whims. Al-Sheikh, also, charges: ?The Muslim world is not your backyard.? \n\nfor screenshots http://www.siteinstitute.org/bin/articles.cgi?ID=publications89605&amp;Category=publications&amp;Subcategory=0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:727104c8233c57e13e49cfbcfe2daf3778318901","amp;dn":"Al-Qaeda%5C%27s+Video+Presentation+of++%3FThe+War+of+the+Oppressed%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"727104c8233c57e13e49cfbcfe2daf3778318901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,113,4,200,35,60,87,225,62,73,207,188,254,45,175,55,120,49,137,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
