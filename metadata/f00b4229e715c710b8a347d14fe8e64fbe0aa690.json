Then simply copy paste the folders in this torrent to the root of your memory stick and the game plays fine. I noticed the movies are ripped out but that&amp;#039;s to make it work on 512mb memory sticks. Full ISO unrared comes to 441MB.\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Note&gt;&gt;&gt; The MPH Loader in this torrent will make the GTA text spanish. (only for those who downloaded my version of EXIT from piratebay. Now with this UMD Emu and MPHLoader1.1. GTA will play in English. Just copy paste all the folders to memstick root(MUST delete the previous MPHLoader folders(3 of them) before copying the new one!!!) GTA will play in English now.\n\n\nIGN Review Score(Overall)  : 9.5 [Outstanding]\n-------------------------\nIGN Closing Comments\n--------------------\nDaxter is simply an outstanding PSP game that brings back the old-school platform gaming the industry has been shying more and more away from. Sure, its story is kind of ridiculous and even a little boring, but the events that said story lead into are fantastic. From the great level design to the ultra-refined controls to the excellent production values, Daxter is a game every PSP gamer should check out.\n\nPresentation          : 9.5\n------------\nStreaming world, the ability to save anywhere, great music and tons more is only hindered a bit by its not-so-great story.\n\nGraphics              : 9.5\n--------\nComing about as close to the console series as possible on the PSP, this game simply looks fantastic.\n\nSound                 : 9.0\n-----\nGreat audio effects and a killer soundtrack that all play with excellent fidelity.\n\nGameplay              : 8.5\n--------\nGreat platforming through and through that harkens back to the good &amp;#039;ol days of gaming.\n\nLasting Appeal        : 8.0\n--------------\nThe game lasts a reasonable amount of time, but going back through to collect everything along with the mini-games and nice Bug Combat will keep you hooked.\n\n\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00b4229e715c710b8a347d14fe8e64fbe0aa690","amp;dn":"Daxter+Working+on+MPHoader+fw1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00b4229e715c710b8a347d14fe8e64fbe0aa690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,11,66,41,231,21,199,16,184,163,71,209,79,232,230,79,190,10,166,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
