A Professor Danforth, who is convinced that the Martians will soon invade Earth, persuades the boys to help him with his new military invention (a craft with the ability to move on the ground like a tank, in the air like a helicopter, in the water like a submarine, or even in orbit like a spacecraft) and in return he&amp;#039;ll create a new &quot;electronic animation&quot; machine for them to use in their TV show. The Martians, meanwhile send two spies, Ogg and Zogg to Earth to prepare for the invasion. When Moe accidentally sends a television transmission through the Martian&amp;#039;s communication device, they are offended and call off the invasion, opting instead to destroy the Earth. After the vehicle is built and given a test run by the Stooges, the Martians steal it and mount their own &quot;ray gun&quot; on it, then begin destroying selected targets. The boys are able to sneak onto the craft and attempt to stop the Martians, ultimately cutting the &quot;helicopter&quot; part off the vehicle with a stolen Martian ray-gun pistol. The Martians are defeated, and the boys&amp;#039; new electronic animation device saves their show! \t\t\n\n\n\nthe 1st attempt stopped at 99,9 %, this is the 2nd try\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc811ccca77dba442966300b2be54908179879d","amp;dn":"216.+The+Three+Stooges+in+Orbit+%281962%29+RETRY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc811ccca77dba442966300b2be54908179879d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,200,17,204,202,119,219,164,66,150,99,0,178,190,84,144,129,121,135,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
