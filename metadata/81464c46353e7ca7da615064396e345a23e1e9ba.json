PassMark \nPerformanceTest ? allows you to objectively benchmark a PC using a variety \nof \ndifferent speed tests and compare the results to other computers.\n\nFind out if your PC is performing at its best. \nCompare the performance of your machine to similar machines. \nMeasure the effect of configuration changes and upgrades. \nAvoid paying big bucks for poor performance. \nMake objective independent measurements on which to base your\npurchasing decision. Versions:\nV6.0 (Build 1008) Win32 \nV6.0 (Build 1008) Win64 \n\nLatest release date:\n18 November 2005 (Win32) \n22 November 2005 (Win64) \n\nPlatforms:\nWindows 98, ME, 2000, XP, 2003 Server.\nAvailable for both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.\n(Windows 95 and NT are not supported)\n(Windows 98 requires IE 5.0 or higher) \n\nRequirements:\n800x600 pixel display, DirectX 9.0 or higher, 64 MB RAM, 5 MB of free hard \ndisk space (plus additional hard disk space to run the Disk test). \n\nOptional PerformanceTest hardware accessories:\nTest CDs\nTest DVDs\n\nRelated downloads \nPerformanceTest Baselines\nPerformanceTest Documentation\n\n\nUse the advanced tests to create you own benchmark scenarios \n\n\nTwenty five standard benchmark tests are available in six test suites plus \nthere are five advanced testing windows for custom benchmarking. \n\nStandard test suites \n\nCPU tests Mathematical operations, compression, encryption, SSE, 3DNow! \ninstructions and more \n2D graphics tests Drawing lines, bitmaps, fonts, text, and GUI elements \n3D graphics tests Simple to complex DirectX 3D graphics and animations\n\nDisk tests Reading, writing and seeking within disk files \nMemory tests Allocating and accessing memory speed and efficiency\n\nCD / DVD test Test the speed of your CD or DVD drive \nAdvanced configurable tests\n\nAdvanced Disk \nAdvanced CD / DVD \nAdvanced 3D graphics \nAdvanced Networking** (for Ethernet, Internet and Wireless) \nAdvanced Memory** \nAdvanced Multi-tasking** \nPassMark Rating and comparable baselines\nIn addition to the standard tests, there are 7 summary results plus the \noverall &quot;PassMark Rating&quot; result. The benchmark results are presented as \neasy \nto read bar charts so that you don&amp;#039;t need to spend hours studying the number \n\nto know the result. Timing for the tests is done using high resolution \ntimers, which are accurate to approximately 1 millionth of a second on most \nPC&amp;#039;s.\n\nA major advantage is the support for built-in baseline results which allows \nyou to compare computer systems (a baseline is a standard set of results \nfrom \nanother computer). These baseline results can be used to determine how fast \nyour computer is in comparison with other computer systems.\n\nThe evaluation version of PerformanceTest contains the baseline results from \n\nseven different computer systems. After the software is purchased the user \ncan access PassMark&amp;#039;s database of baseline results where many other \nbenchmark \nresults can be downloaded.\n\nAdditional Features\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81464c46353e7ca7da615064396e345a23e1e9ba","amp;dn":"PassMark.PerformanceTest.v6.0.1008.WinALL.Cracked-ARN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81464c46353e7ca7da615064396e345a23e1e9ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,70,76,70,53,62,124,167,218,97,80,100,57,110,52,90,35,225,233,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
