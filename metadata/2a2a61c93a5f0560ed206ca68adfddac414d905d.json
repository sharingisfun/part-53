Marshall also plays\n    flute and the electronic valve instrument (EVI).\n\n    Lineup includes saxophonists Charles Davis (who joined in 1955),\n    Noel Scott, Rey Scott and Yahya Abdul-Majid, trumpeters Michael\n    Ray and Fred Adams, trombonists Tyrone Hill and Gene Davis,\n    guitarist D. Hotep, bass Juini Booth, drummer Luquman Ali and\n    percussionists Art Jenkins and Elson Nascimento. \n\n    Sun Ra left this planet in 1993 handing the keys to the Arkestra\n    to John Gilmore who in turn passed them on to Marshall Allen, an\n    admirable space captain if there ever was one.\n\nThis is my corrected version of the free simulcast download MP3 available on CKUT.ca; I have cut the hour-long segments into just the two sets and removed the many annoying stream-delay drop-outs.  Both files are 128kbps\nMP3 files, just like the original copies; this may not be optimum but it\nis still better than the 64k mono stream that was put out over the net that night.\n\nThis is my first ever uploaded torrent; I hope I got it right ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a2a61c93a5f0560ed206ca68adfddac414d905d","amp;dn":"Sun+Ra+-+2006+-+Montreal+La+Sala+Rosa+2006-06-06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a2a61c93a5f0560ed206ca68adfddac414d905d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,42,97,201,58,95,5,96,237,32,108,166,138,223,221,172,65,77,144,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
