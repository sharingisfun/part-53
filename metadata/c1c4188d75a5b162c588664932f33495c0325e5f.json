Release notes ??????????????????????????????????????? ??? ? ?\n\n     Easily the best Prodigy album out there, and that&amp;#039;s\n     really saying something. All of the tracks are based in\n     energetic hardcore techno, but there&amp;#039;s an incredible\n     amount of variety here. Everything from metal guitars\n     (&quot;Their Law&quot;) to shattering glass (&quot;Break and Enter&quot;)\n     is used as a sample, and all are used effectively. The\n     album doesn&amp;#039;t have a single weak track on it, but the\n     true highlights are the singles. &quot;Poison&quot; is probably\n     the darkest track the Prodigy&amp;#039;s ever done\n     (**including** &quot;Firestarter&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;) and it&amp;#039;s\n     great. &quot;One Love&quot; sounds a lot like an older rave\n     track, but it works really well and doesn&amp;#039;t overstay\n     its welcome. &quot;Voodoo People&quot; uses LIVE guitars and\n     flutes in a breakbeat track that will get you moving\n     like no other. Then there&amp;#039;s my favorite: &quot;No Good\n     (Start The Dance)&quot; which pastes together a sped-up soul\n     vocal and a ridiculously intense beat. It&amp;#039;ll leave you\n     gasping for air, but in a good way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c4188d75a5b162c588664932f33495c0325e5f","amp;dn":"Prodigy-Music_For_The_Jilted_Generation-1994-CBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c4188d75a5b162c588664932f33495c0325e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,196,24,141,117,165,177,98,197,136,102,73,50,243,52,149,192,50,94,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
