You can use it to interpolate, or blow up, your images to larger sizes. At the end of 2003 I needed a program like Shortcut PhotoZoom Pro for two reasons. I wanted to create a 30x20 inch print at 254dpi from a Canon EOS 10D source file, and I also needed to interpolate some 10D files up to 48Mb in size for submission to an image library. So did Shortcut PhotoZoom Pro deliver on its promises? Did it create a quality print for me and were my stock images accepted? Find out in my review.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8b2076c1ac7696726436644f4b7b743ecf9695","amp;dn":"PhotoZoom.Professional+v.1.1.10+%2B+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8b2076c1ac7696726436644f4b7b743ecf9695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,139,32,118,193,172,118,150,114,100,54,100,79,75,123,116,62,207,150,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
