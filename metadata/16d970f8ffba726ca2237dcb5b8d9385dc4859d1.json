Too bad I will never ever buy a HP... So after more than a few hours with a friends HP recovery DVDs I managed to put together a package that'll install hptunes onto non-hp machines- giving you full control of itunes while in XP Media Center\n\n-I have only tested this on XPMCE 2005, I have no idea if it'l work on 2004. Let me know if you try.\n\nI hope someone else finds this useful.\n\nfezz\n\nFixes:\n- Improves performance with Media Center.\n- Resolves visual issues in Now Playing view.\n- Resolves limitation in scrolling through a large music list.\n- Supports control of screen saver and performance optimization settings within HP Tunes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d970f8ffba726ca2237dcb5b8d9385dc4859d1","amp;dn":"HPTUNES-play+itunes+through+XPMCE2005+%28XP+Media+Center+Edition+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d970f8ffba726ca2237dcb5b8d9385dc4859d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,217,112,248,255,186,114,108,162,35,125,203,91,141,147,133,220,72,89,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
