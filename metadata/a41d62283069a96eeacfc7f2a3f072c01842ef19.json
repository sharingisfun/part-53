The programme spanning the three discs is narrated and bridged by Simon Jones, and the entire thing is laid out in an &quot;A to Z&quot; format.\n\nExcerpted are such programs as &quot;The Burkiss Way,&quot; with 2 clips from 1977, Last Chance to See (the radio series), with 4 clips from 1989, many many clips from the Omnibus tribute to Douglas Adams from the 4th of August 2001 (which I believe is on the US edition of the H2G2 DVDs, in its entirety), 4 clips from his very last radio project (while alive) &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Future&quot;, from late 2000, and a couple of clips from his first Doctor Who story, &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; (as well as a radio interview about Doctor Who that also appears on &quot;Doctor Who at the BBC, Vol. 1&quot;).\n\nWhile a lot of clips from/about H2G2 itself are conspicuous by their absense, Simon Jones himself says on disc 2 that so much has been said and written about the series already, that further statements would be redundant. But there's still quite a wealth of material here, and lots of it has NOT been released in recorded form before (with the two exceptions noted above).\n\nOverall, I give it a fairly high score, 4 out of 5, as it's nice to finally be able to hear a lot of the material that IS referred to within the various biographies (again, as noted above). Although I have to admit I like the version of the Kamikaze sketch that has its script printed in &quot;Don't Panic&quot; over the recorded version here (although, granted, that one is written for a visual presentation, and the other is an audio adaptation). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41d62283069a96eeacfc7f2a3f072c01842ef19","amp;dn":"Douglas+Adams+at+the+BBC+%283cd+MP3%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41d62283069a96eeacfc7f2a3f072c01842ef19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,29,98,40,48,105,169,110,234,207,199,242,163,240,114,192,24,66,239,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
