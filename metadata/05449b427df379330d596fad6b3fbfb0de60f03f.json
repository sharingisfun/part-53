DC Comics has been wise enough to publish it, under the Helix imprint. It is, on the surface, an amusing, obscene story about a guy who's a lot like Hunter S. Thompson. He lives in some science fictional city and writes a newspaper column. He has a cat. It's very funny and you will laugh often while reading it.\n\nBut that's what's on the top. Fuck the obvious. What we really have here is a stingingly potent social satire. It's Ellis and Robertson writing and drawing everything they hate and love about the City, every city, all cities. It's a protagonist who partakes of the bile and anger and righteousness of every moral journalist since H. L. Mencken. It's got a stiletto hidden during the entire pratfall, and if you get too close you'll find out it stings.\n\nRead the comic, if you aren't already.
