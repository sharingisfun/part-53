This DVD will provide some good insight as to what goes on during the photoshoots and after. Provocative and erotic as it all may be, you'll find out that it's really just entertainment. \n\nBesides Ayaka modeling, you'll get the chance to know a bit more about her, as she answers some personal questions throughout and takes part in some fun activities.\n\nThe highlight of this DVD is seeing how well Ayaka can play Ping-Pong. She's won trophies and is one of the best players from Iwate Prefecture.\n\nThe film makers had the Omake a part of the Main segment.\n\nReleased by [AK] Arctic Knight Productions\nhttp://www.arcticknight.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d22acf745e132bc1a99689b028345426ce36c74","amp;dn":"%5BAK%5D+Komatsu+Ayaka+-+Masaka+%28Idol+DVD%29+%28XviD%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d22acf745e132bc1a99689b028345426ce36c74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,34,172,247,69,225,50,188,26,153,104,155,2,131,69,66,108,227,108,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
