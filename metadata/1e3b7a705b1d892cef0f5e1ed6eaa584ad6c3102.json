I you want to use other skins,\n   make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.\n   DonÃ‚Â´t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - YouÃ‚Â´re on your own here !\n\n   I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface\n   from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice Ã‚Â´coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.\n   \n   Added Weather Display to Home Screen (visible only with Internet connection)\n   It displays the currently selected city from the Weather menu.   \n\n   You can get more Skins here:\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&amp;cat=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&amp;cat=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   SCRIPTS INCLUDED:\n\n   FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers\n   QuickTimeBrowser [fixed] (Movie Trailers) / SubmenuEditor \n   WebRadio (simpleKML V2) / XBMCLyrics / XBMCScripts\n\n   All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style and appear in the Scripts Submenu.\n   You can change the Submenu appearance with the SubmenuEditor yourself. \n\n   Get more Scripts via the XBMCScripts menu or @ http://www.xbmcscripts.com  \n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   VISUALISATION ADDONS INCLUDED (All Zipped):\n\n   G-Force:  1507 total (including the CVS supplied ones)\n   MilkDrop MegaPack: 7977 total (including the CVS supplied ones)\n   MilkDrop: BritneysPAIRS 110 favorite MilkDrop Presets\n              \n   I slightly modified some settings in /visualisations/milkdrop.xml\n   The MilkDrop MegaPack is the default MilkDrop Preset Pack.\n   The original file from CVS has been renamed to milkdrop.xml.CVS\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   ABOUT TRAINERS:\n\n   There are 539 Trainers included to give you a good start.\n   I collected these from the net (including Mikerowesoft Packs 1-3) and deleted\n   all (binary) dupes. I absolutely donÃ‚Â´t know which ones work and which donÃ‚Â´t ! \n   PLEASE do not ask me anything about the included Trainers.\n\n   Trainer files need to be in /system/Trainers - Use the context menu on a Game\n   listed in MY PROGRAMS to refresh the Trainer List or to change Trainer options. \n\n   Get Trainers e.g. @ http://trainers.maxconsole.net (Free Registration required)\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   RELEASE NOTES:\n\n   Finally i was able to get new Sources again ...\n   Access to XBMC Sources on SourceForge was impossible since 2006-03-13 \n\n   Added BritneysPAIRS 110 favorite MilkDrop Presets.\n   Choose MilkDrop BritneysPAIRS (110).zip from the MilkDrop configuration screen.   \n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   CHANGELOG:\n\n   To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can\n   see whatÃ‚Â´s included here.
