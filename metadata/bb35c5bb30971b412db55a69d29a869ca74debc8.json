I decided to put these together when cdbrown and myself decided we wanted to undertake the task of doing the mamevids, and new screenshots as well. The main reason for doing screenshots is because others that we have found to use are unuseable for our personal purposes. The others seem to get stretched and pixelated in certain frontends when you want to make a larger layout. These screens were taken at their native res to help avoid this situation when you want to enlarge the screenshot window. Of course you dont have to use these at all. Just thought I would share with the rest of the community so you'd have another option :) . I also want you to know that the screens are individually labeled into their own rar file: #-A, B, C, etc. Also included are rar's of nonworking(parent) and mature screens. ***Please note that mature screens are also already in the individual rar's as well, so if you do not wish for them you'll have to take them out.***  Use the mature rar as a reference to remove all unwanted screens. Big thanks to cdbrown, and a very special thanks to Justmichael. As always, feel free to visit http://www.arcadecontrols.com.
