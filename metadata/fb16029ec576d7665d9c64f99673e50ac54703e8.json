Paint.NET is jointly developed at Washington State University with additional help from Microsoft, and is meant to be a free replacement for the MS Paint software. The program offers a clean and easy to understand interface that includes all common editing tools, as well as clone stamp and various image effects. More advanced users will also appreciate the fact that Paint.NET supports layers with transparency and layer adjustments. Additional features include Red-Eye removal, image resizing, sharpening, multi-level Undo and more.\n&lt;p&gt;\n\n\nRequires .NET  framework 1.1 or later.\n&lt;p&gt;\nThis program can be downloaded from  http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/ when the the site is not down, which it always is, why I decided to put it here as a torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb16029ec576d7665d9c64f99673e50ac54703e8","amp;dn":"Paint.NET+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb16029ec576d7665d9c64f99673e50ac54703e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,22,2,158,197,118,215,102,93,156,100,249,150,115,229,10,197,71,3,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
