Frost has to investigate two deaths simultaneously: a homeless teenage girl, Jane Owens, found beaten up and drowned in Denton's river; and that of an environmental health officer, Warren Barber, after a dismembered arm is washed up on the shoreline on the other side of England, near Hull. The first investigation takes him into the world of Denton's homeless; the second leads to the investigation of a local meat processing factory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e64432917be64ed8bc677a855eff068ef0d54b","amp;dn":"A+Touch+Of+Frost+-+6x02-++One+Man%5C%27S+Meat%281999%29+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e64432917be64ed8bc677a855eff068ef0d54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,230,68,50,145,123,230,78,216,188,103,122,133,94,255,6,142,240,213,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
