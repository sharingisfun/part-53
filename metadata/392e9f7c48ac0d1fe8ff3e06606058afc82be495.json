Title track is one of the rarest, most collectable singles of the 60's. Features many other collectors rarities. Long before he formed Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore had already won a sizeable reputation amongst London?s musical cognoscenti. As a sessionman and as featured guitarist with Joe Meek?s Outlaws, he had been showing off his skills since the dawn of the 60s. Getaway features the pick of these collectable 60s outings, including his legendary 1965 solo single, his cameos with stars such as Heinz and Lord Sutch, and his contributions to the mysterious Green Bullfrog project.\n\nDisc 1 - \n\n01.The Outlaws - Return Of The Outlaws \n02.Chad Carson - A Fool In Love \n03.Chad Carson - Jesse James \n04.Burr Bailey And The Six-Shooters - Like A Bird Without Feathers \n05.Silas Dooley Jr. - There's Something At The Bottom Of The Garden \n06.Silas Dooley Jr. - Out Behind the Barn \n07.Heinz - Just Like Eddie \n08.Gene Vincent - Crazy Beat (Live) \n09.Various Artists - Catch Me A Rat \n10.Gene Vincent - Catch Me A Rat (Live) \n11.Michael Cox - I've Been Thinking \n12.Michael Cox - In This Lonesome Old House \n13.Glenda Collins - If You Gotta Pick A Baby \n14.Gunilla Thorne - Go On Then \n15.The Sharades - Boy Trouble \n16.Andy Cavell - Tell The Truth \n17.Davy Kaye - A Fool Such As I \n18.The Outlaws - Keep A-Knocking \n19.The Outlaws - Shake With Me \n20.Glenda Collins - Everybody's Got To Fall In Love \n21.The Rally Rounders - Bike Beat (Part 1) \n22.The Rally Rounders - Bike Beat (Part 2) \n23.Tanya Day And The Nu-Notes - I Get So Lonely \n24.The Outlaws - Only For You \n25.The Sessions - Bouncing Bass \n26.The Sessions - Let Me In \n27.Various Artists - BBC 1 Radio Interview\n \nDisc 2 -\n \n01.Getaway \n02.Little Brown Jug \n03.The Lancasters - Satan's Holiday \n04.The Lancasters - Earthshaker \n05.Heinz And The Wildboys - Don't Think Twice It's Alright \n06.Heinz And The Wildboys - Big Fat Spider \n07.Jess Conrad - It Can Happen To You \n08.Screaming Lord Sutch And The Savages - Train Kept A-Rollin' \n09.Screaming Lord Sutch And The Savages - Honey Hush \n10.Heinz And The Wild Boys - I'm Not A Bad Guy \n11.The Soul Brothers - Goodbye Baby Goodbye \n12.Ronnie Jones - Satisfy My Soul \n13.Ronnie Jones - My Only Souvenir \n14.The New Soul Brothers - Girl It's You \n15.Tony Wilson - What Did I Do? \n16.Neil Christian And The Crusaders - My Baby Left Me \n17.Neil Christian And The Crusaders - Yaketty Yak \n18.Boz - I Shall Be Released \n19.Boz - Down In The Flood \n20.Anan - Standing Still \n21.Sun Dragon - So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star \n22.Sun Dragon - Five White Horses \n23.Green Bullfrog - Who Do You Love \n24.Green Bullfrog - Ain't Nobody Home \n25.Green Bullfrog - Louisiana Man \n26.Green Bullfrog - Bullfrog\n\nhttp://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/b1/0b/141c92c008a04df3711e7010.L.jpg \nhttp://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/13/97/6cea92c008a02df3711e7010.L.jpg\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392e9f7c48ac0d1fe8ff3e06606058afc82be495","amp;dn":"Ritchie+Blackmore+-+Getaway%2C+Groups+%26+Sessions+1963-70","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392e9f7c48ac0d1fe8ff3e06606058afc82be495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,46,159,124,72,172,13,31,232,255,62,6,96,96,88,175,200,43,228,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
