Half-Life 2 takes computer games to a new level of realism with incredible in-game graphics that recreate familiar-looking city streets, and blend them with strange and grotesque monsters, resulting in a believable and at times unsettling environment. Objects and characters feature accurate physics properties, behaving with the appropriate mass, density, and physical properties of their real-life counterparts. Extremely intelligent computer AI result in enemies that plan, adapt, and respond to the player's actions. \n\n\nGame Info\n\nDeveloper Valve  \nPublisher Electronic Arts  \nGenre Shooter \nRelease Date November 15, 2005  \nESRB Mature for Blood and Gore, Intense Violence  \nGameSpy Score N/A  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903f503aff6c6ce255fa1f3dd6f6e2654ce12fc1","amp;dn":"Xbox+-+RLT+-+Half+LIfe+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903f503aff6c6ce255fa1f3dd6f6e2654ce12fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,63,80,58,255,108,108,226,85,250,31,61,214,246,226,101,76,225,47,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
