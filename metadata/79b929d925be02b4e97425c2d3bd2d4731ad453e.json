Unfortunately for them, the mobsters smack David around a bit, and of course, he gets angry and turns into the Hulk. \n\nDuring the ensuing brawl, an innocent bystander is winged and Banner ends up in custody. He has to go to trial as a witness once he reverts back to his human form, and the police get him under wraps just as soon as that happens. \n\nAppointed as his lawyer is Matt Murdock (Rex Smith of The Pirates Of Penzance), a blind attorney who is adamant that he should testify, as he wants to be able to connect the hit job to one Wilson Fisk (John Rhys-Davies of Lord Of The Rings), as known as the Kingpin of crime. \n\nMurdock also happens to be Daredevil, a masked vigilante who was blinded in a childhood accident involving some by nuclear goop that robbed him of his sight but in the process enhanced his other senses to amazing heights and gifted him with radar sense as well. \n\nUltimately the pair teams up to find the evidence that they need to bring together their case against the evil Kingpin before he and his thugs take them down permanently. \n\nWhile these movies don?t really follow their comic book counterparts very closely at all, they still manage to be a lot of fun and Bixby and Ferrigno turn in some great performances. The highlights of each film are of course, the brawls that the Hulk manages to get himself into and it?s a lot of fun seeing him work with other characters from the Marvel universe, even though Thor and Daredevil are kinda hooky and goofy looking in these incarnations compared to their four-color counterparts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79b929d925be02b4e97425c2d3bd2d4731ad453e","amp;dn":"The+Trial+of+the+Incredible+Hulk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79b929d925be02b4e97425c2d3bd2d4731ad453e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,185,41,217,37,190,2,180,233,116,37,194,211,189,45,71,49,173,69,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
