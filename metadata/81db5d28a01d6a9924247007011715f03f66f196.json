However,\n         it was still approximately 130megs to big for a DVDR. This left us with a\n         few options. One option was to re-encode the entire movie. Another option \n         was to cut most of the end credits (something we've done in the past), and\n         yet another was to re-encode the end credits. But we only had 30 megs of\n         space left for 4 minutes of end credits, which wasn't enough for a decent\n         bitrate. So instead of cutting the credits, or re-encoding the full movie,\n         we came up with another alternative. We re-encoded the first cell (aproximately 60 seconds, containing studio logos and intro credits) and the second to last cell, which contained the end credits. This allowed us to keep the movie\n         itself untouched (except where noted) and keep the credits for those that want them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81db5d28a01d6a9924247007011715f03f66f196","amp;dn":"Land.Of.The.Dead.UNRATED.DVDR-Replica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81db5d28a01d6a9924247007011715f03f66f196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,219,93,40,160,29,106,153,36,36,112,7,1,23,21,240,63,102,241,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
