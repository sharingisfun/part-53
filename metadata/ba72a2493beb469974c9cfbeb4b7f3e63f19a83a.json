It stars Whitney Houston who apparently made enemies with some other divas that very evening, such as Cher, Mary Blige etc.\n\nHowever, there was this one girl that I kind of fell in love with, who, in my opinion, stole the show completely: Leann Rimes. Not only was the famous voice of Whitney Houston?s a lot below average that evening while Leann's voice glowed of golden warmth. Also, Leann is very beautiful and wore a beautiful skirt that evening (ahh, that skirt!). Above all, she didn't act like a diva at all but very natural and perhaps a bit shy, too. As the presenting host, Elton John, says: a FANTASTIC girl.\n\nEncoded from commercial dvd to the highest quality .avi I was able to, using DivX.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba72a2493beb469974c9cfbeb4b7f3e63f19a83a","amp;dn":"Leann+Rimes%3A+How+do+I+Live+LIVE+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba72a2493beb469974c9cfbeb4b7f3e63f19a83a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,114,162,73,59,235,70,153,116,201,207,190,180,183,243,230,63,25,168,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
