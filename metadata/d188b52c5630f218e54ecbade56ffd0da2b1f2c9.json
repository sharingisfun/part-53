They were either stolen from him, or were leaked through a cohort. Most of the songs are exclusive to this record and are still essential, two songs appeared years later in the Stage series. It is unknown if the songs on this album were meant for a specific project, or if Zappa mixed them for fun or for some other purpose. [One guy claimed he had a copy with &quot;test pressing&quot; written on the labels, but this has not been verified - Ed.] Apocrypha used most of the songs from this record.\n\nLength: 31:50\nSound quality: Soundboard / various\nMatrix: ML-001 (also L-6150)\n\nThere were at least two versions of this.\n\n1.
