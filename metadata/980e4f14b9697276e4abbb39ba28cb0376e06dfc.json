I must say...DO NOT get this if you are not a fan...you won't &quot;get&quot; it and will most likely hate it.  If you are a fan, and you like &quot;B&quot; movies, then go for it, I laughed my ass off, and do not regret my purchase.\n\nThe best part in the movie is the &quot;Bar Fight&quot; scene....&quot;So you want to fight dirty?&quot; LOL!\n\nSorry, no subs here, there were none on the dvd!  Also it should be noted, that like most of his movies, it was a multiregion dvd with ZERO encryption. ;)\n\nThis film also had some big actors in it, like Stacy Keach...\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nThe Man with the Screaming Brain is cult superstar Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead 2), who also makes his directorial debut in this loopy blend of '50s-style science fiction thrills and slapstick comedy. Campbell plays a businessman who meets an untimely end at the hands of a vicious Gypsy femme fatale, who has also done in her ex-fianc&amp;eacute;e, an KGB-agent-turned-taxi-driver. Mad doctor Stacy Keach provides a solution for both men by stitching together their brains inside Campbell's dome; with no other option but to work together, the pair sent out to find their killer. What results is a broadly funny and frantic showcase for Campbell's physical comedy skills, with Ted Raimi (Spider-Man, Xena) offering hilarious support as Keach's wacky assistant.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 958 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x368 = 1.74:1\nAudio: English, 128 kb/s VBR AVG Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 01:29:34\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
