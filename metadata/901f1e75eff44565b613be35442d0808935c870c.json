Inside that image of E.L.O.'s spaceship (here updated without the 8-track docking bay), one imagines a ye olde discotheque stuffed with Beatles mannequins and powered by pump organ synthesizers. The genius of Jeff Lynne is to fuse kindergarten rock &amp;amp; roll, ultra-Liverpudlian choruses, and faux-symphonic instrumentation with a pop that's both sappy and supple. With only a few duff tracks, this timeless, invigorating disc is a rocking, left-field surprise. Talk about a comeback--Zoom is nothing short of a revelation for fans of this critically underappreciated group. Lynne sings on the opening cut, &amp;quot;Alright,&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;You've got to hold onto something that you believe / Hold onto something that makes you feel alright,&amp;quot; and the entire album bears this out with grace and wit.\nSearch for KingStar to find the rest of my torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:901f1e75eff44565b613be35442d0808935c870c","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra+-+Zoom+%40320+Kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"901f1e75eff44565b613be35442d0808935c870c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,31,30,117,239,244,69,101,182,19,190,53,68,45,8,8,147,92,135,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
