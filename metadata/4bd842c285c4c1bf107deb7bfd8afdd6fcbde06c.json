So, they can serve as a soundtrack to get it on to.\n\n3: Humor: I got a lot of comedy on this list, too.  Most of it has made me laugh, but yet again... my sense of humor is really good so anything makes me laugh...\n\n4: Just plain collecting: There&amp;#039;s like 500 songs in this list.  So, if you&amp;#039;re just a collector like I am, it can boost your media library a good bit.\n\nThe list of songs is detailed in http://freewebs.com/virtualdrivec/Lightblade&amp;#039;s Music.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd842c285c4c1bf107deb7bfd8afdd6fcbde06c","amp;dn":"Lightblade%5C%27s+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd842c285c4c1bf107deb7bfd8afdd6fcbde06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,216,66,194,133,196,193,191,16,125,235,123,253,138,253,214,252,189,224,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
