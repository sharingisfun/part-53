I know i did, but only to support the band... And cos of the track 'lean on me', cos thats almost the only things making it worth anything. I allready have all the other albums, so 3 tracks ain't that much. \n\nAnyway, that's not the issue now. I would like to introduce this extremly cool fan made video, which is made by a fan of Limp Bizkit (well, duh) from our forum. They did their own little video of 'the key' from the album released previously this year, 'the unquestionable truth (part 1)'\n\ncredits goes to B&amp;eacute;nou, Julien amd a key for making this video... check it out, it's kewl!!\n\n~kaw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9afad58e6612f21dd08c77fb036d4bff6a0a35","amp;dn":"Limp+Bizkit+-+The+Key+%28Best+fan-video+ever%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9afad58e6612f21dd08c77fb036d4bff6a0a35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,154,250,213,142,102,18,242,29,208,140,119,251,3,109,75,255,106,10,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
