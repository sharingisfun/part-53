The video contains candid interviews with well-known New Age leaders like David Spangler and Benjamin Creme, as well as interviews with leading Christian authorities on the New Age like Dave Hunt, Constance Cumbey and Martin and Diedre Bobgan. \n\nShot on location, the video takes you into the center of some New Age activities and the documentary itself examines many New Age ideas from holisitc health, yoga, hypnosis and trancendental meditation to New Age education practices, global government and the human potential movment. The evidence presented is sure to convince even skeptics that a New Age movement has solid footing in every aspect of American society and is gaining momentum at incredible speed.\n\n&quot;No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a luciferian Initiation.&quot; \n\n--David Spangler, Director of Planetary Initiative, United Nations.\n\nFilesize.....: 349 MB (or 358,350 KB or 366,950,400 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:47:24 (193,138 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 322 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 352x272 (1.29:1) [=22:17]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9927c5fd79b1006fb76b5321c23ebe16384717ca","amp;dn":"The+New+Age%3A+A+Pathway+to+Paradise+%3F+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9927c5fd79b1006fb76b5321c23ebe16384717ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,39,197,253,121,177,0,111,183,107,83,33,194,62,190,22,56,71,23,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
