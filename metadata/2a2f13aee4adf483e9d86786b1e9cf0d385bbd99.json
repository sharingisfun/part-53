Fearing scandal, the school insists it was suicide. But after discovering from the boy's girlfriend, Carlin, that he was being badly bullied, Abel suspects that a dangerous schoolboy initiation has gone horribly wrong and he secretly solicits the help of a sympathetic teacher, Betsy. He is warned off the investigation by his boss, as the school is a generous benefactor to the Police benevolent fund. Abel, however, cannot let the case go, not only because his own brother committed suicide years before, but also it seems that the spirit of the dead boy is leaving them clues as to what really happened that night. \nA supernatural murder mystery, based on Alice Hoffman's novel, about a cop who investigates a student's suicide.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Suspense\nDVD Source Region: 3,4 \nMovie Encoding: H264/AVC\nEncoding Profile: Maximum Definition AVC \nFrame Size: 752x320\nAspect Ratio(s): 2.35:1 (Widescreen Anamorphic)\nAudio Encoding: ADTS AAC LC \nMPAA: Not Rated\nRated:  (R) (Not for sale to persons under age 18.) \nAvailable subtitles: English, Portuguese\nAvailable Audio Tracks: English (ADTS AAC LC 640 kbps)\n\nMPEG-4 Detailed information\n* Movie Info *\n        Timescale 1000 - Duration 01:39:31.520\n        Fragmented File no - 8 track(s)\n        File Brand avc1 - version 0\n\nFile has root IOD\nScene PL 0x01 - Graphics PL 0xfe - OD PL 0xfe\nVisual PL: No visual capability required (0xff)\nAudio PL: AAC Profile @ Level 4 (0x2a)\n\nChapters:\n        Chapter #1 - 00:00:00.000 - &quot;Chapter 1&quot;\n        Chapter #2 - 00:03:19.500 - &quot;Chapter 2&quot;\n        Chapter #3 - 00:13:34.000 - &quot;Chapter 3&quot;\n        Chapter #4 - 00:25:36.000 - &quot;Chapter 4&quot;\n        Chapter #5 - 00:34:44.000 - &quot;Chapter 5&quot;\n        Chapter #6 - 00:43:05.000 - &quot;Chapter 6&quot;\n        Chapter #7 - 00:50:44.500 - &quot;Chapter 7&quot;\n        Chapter #8 - 01:01:15.000 - &quot;Chapter 8&quot;\n        Chapter #9 - 01:09:17.000 - &quot;Chapter 9&quot;\n        Chapter #10 - 01:18:08.000 - &quot;Chapter 10&quot;\n        Chapter #11 - 01:25:40.500 - &quot;Chapter 11&quot;\n        Chapter #12 - 01:33:39.000 - &quot;Chapter 12&quot;\n        Chapter #13 - 01:39:24.500 - &quot;Chapter 13&quot;\n\nTrack # 1 Info - TrackID 1 - TimeScale 1000 - Duration 00:00:00.001\nTrack is present in Root OD\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;odsm&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4s&quot; - 1 samples\nMPEG-4 Config: ObjectDescriptor Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x01\nSelf-synchronized\n\nTrack # 2 Info - TrackID 2 - TimeScale 1000 - Duration 00:00:00.001\nTrack is present in Root OD\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;sdsm&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4s&quot; - 1 samples\nMPEG-4 Config: SceneDescription Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x01\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nTrack # 3 Info - TrackID 3 - TimeScale 30000 - Duration 01:39:25.526\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;vide&quot; - Sub Type &quot;avc1&quot; - 178787 sa\nMPEG-4 Config: Visual Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x21\nAVC/H264 Video - Visual Size 752 x 320\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nTrack # 4 Info - TrackID 4 - TimeScale 90000 - Duration 01:32:23.638\nMedia Info: Language &quot;por&quot; - Type &quot;subp&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4s&quot; - 892 sampl\nMPEG-4 Config: Unknown (0x38) Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0xe0\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nTrack # 5 Info - TrackID 5 - TimeScale 90000 - Duration 01:32:23.638\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;subp&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4s&quot; - 894 sampl\nMPEG-4 Config: Unknown (0x38) Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0xe0\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nTrack # 6 Info - TrackID 6 - TimeScale 48000 - Duration 01:39:31.520\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;soun&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4a&quot; - 279915 sa\nMPEG-4 Config: Audio Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x40\nMPEG-4 Audio AAC LC - 6 Channel(s) - SampleRate 48000\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nTrack # 7 Info - TrackID 7 - TimeScale 1000 - Duration 00:00:01.000\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;odsm&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4s&quot; - 1 samples\nMPEG-4 Config: ObjectDescriptor Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x01\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nTrack # 8 Info - TrackID 8 - TimeScale 1000 - Duration 00:00:01.000\nMedia Info: Language &quot;eng&quot; - Type &quot;sdsm&quot; - Sub Type &quot;mp4s&quot; - 1 samples\nMPEG-4 Config: SceneDescription Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x02\nSynchronized on stream 1\n\nMore infromation: http://www.myriadpictures.com/film.php?film=48\n\nObs: Only playable with Nero Showtime and Nero CE Devices, the default subtitle is Portuguese but you can switch to english","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a2f13aee4adf483e9d86786b1e9cf0d385bbd99","amp;dn":"The+River+King+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a2f13aee4adf483e9d86786b1e9cf0d385bbd99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,47,19,174,228,173,244,131,233,216,103,134,177,233,207,13,56,91,189,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
