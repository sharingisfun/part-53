Mixing heavy\n                       guitars, spastic rhythms and oddly humorous\n                       lyrics, System of a Down have been delivering\n                       their bold statements beginning with their\n                       self-titled debut. Relentless touring and a rabid\n                       underground following positioned System of a Down\n                       to achieve critical and popular acclaim with\n                       Toxicity. 2001 found System of a Down all over\n                       the radio and mainstream media. Despite this\n                       newfound fame, the band members never deviated\n                       from their messages of subversion and political\n                       activism.\n\n                       In 2005, System of a Down released Mezmerize, the\n                       first half of a two volume album. Mezmerize\n                       features a driving attack on the current\n                       government. The fantastic guitar riffs of Daron\n                       Malakian and the inventive battery of bassist\n                       Shavo Odadjian and drummer John Dolmayan power\n                       the engine of System of a Down. Their\n                       astonishingly original music is heard in a new\n                       light on The String Quartet Tribute to System of\n                       a Down. Violins, viola, and cello re-imagine the\n                       songs of Mezmerize as miniature symphonies. These\n                       indelible songs will be enjoyed by both hardcore\n                       System of a Down fans as well as anyone who\n                       appreciates a driving string section.\n\n                                  ANOTHER HOT RELEASE FROM TEAM MoB\n\n                            SUPPORT THE ARTISTS AND BUY THEIR MUSIC, WE DO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1b01e6305a399a22c25af117fee0627a8192bb","amp;dn":"VA-The_String_Quartet_Tribute_to_System_of_A_Downs_Mezmerize-200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1b01e6305a399a22c25af117fee0627a8192bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,27,1,230,48,90,57,154,34,194,90,241,23,254,224,98,122,129,146,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
