I'm Eighteen: Michael Bruce with Richie Scarlet acoustic version. Performed during an interview on KLOL FM Radio in Houston, Texas (United States) on 10-03-97. Reason for this was promotion for a record show Bruce, Glen Buxton, and Neal Smith was going to appear at that up coming Sunday in Houston.\n\nBilly Blues - Houston, Texas 10-10-97\n\n02. Michael Bruce KLOL ID / Commerical\n03. Intro to Hello Hooray - I'm Eighteen\n04. Muscle Of Love - Billion Dollar Babies\n05. School's Out\n06. Under My Wheels\n\nArea 51 - Houston, Texas 10-12-97\n\n07. I'm Eighteen - Under My Wheels\n08. Be My Lover\t\n09. Band Introductions - Desperado\n10. No More Mr. Nice Guy\n11. Muscle Of Love - Billion Dollar Babies\n12. Titanic Overture\n13. School's Out\n14. Hard Hearted Alice - Train Kept A Rollin'\n\nnote: Internet research suggests that the show opener was the beginning of Hello Hooray, in which was followed by Caught In A Dream. This recording seems to pick up after that. Maybe the taper arrived late?\n\nBand:\n\nMichael Bruce - Guitar, Keyboards, and Main Vocals\nGlen Buxton - Guitar (GB! GB! GB!)\nNeal Smith: Drums\n\nAdditional Players:\n\nRichie Scarlet - Bass, and Backing Vocals\nJohn Glenn - Keyboards, and Backing Vocals - local Houston musician \n\nSource(s):\n\nTracks 01 to 06 are obvious enough to be recorded over the radio. I understand that their was bad weather during the Billy Blue's show that effected the Billy Blue's broadcast. Not recorded from the KLOL studios. Remote location - Billy Blue's. Recording itself is a little bass heavy. Some distortion. Tracks 07 to 14 is an audience recording. At the time I did the trade, I was told that this version was new to the trade circles.\n\n&quot;liberatorxxxx&quot; \n\nFLAC Fingerprints:\n\n\n01 I'm Eighteen (acoustic version_Michael Bruce with Richie Scarlet 10-03-97).flac:d673812791429fcb63e39dd9c56c99be\n02 Michael Bruce KLOL Commerical.flac:fe45410ccf25ad8a0fd78ebfb8f097c8\n03 Intro to Hello Hooray - I'm Eighteen.flac:8bc575c945047ae037e7e2fc8c2b2a2d\n04 Muscle Of Love - Billion Dollar Babies.flac:bfaf50cb9ef5e516034368aef5a9f383\n05 School's Out.flac:f01249cbc22b9c817f039e5649479ccf\n06 Under My Wheels.flac:d06d883efa4dcfe5d37d320fc51f0e51\n07 I'm Eighteen - Under My Wheels.flac:632887cec0555350e950e703b9b583a9\n08 Be My Lover.flac:0db20b601b55280da7108dc9b55e2a96\n09 Band Introductions - Desperado.flac:b36daf3996b6f2acc8292b33e893393a\n10 No More Mr Nice Guy.flac:edd664aab440b172e8d865f97ce96ac7\n11 Muscle Of Love - Billion Dollar Babies.flac:c888ce3783aa9ac9f0e87f820762fb27\n12 Titanic Overture.flac:90843f597ed6aa879d49d728f206045c\n13 School's Out.flac:81aafca546b3a6054c4529ca02b9fee7\n14 Hard Hearted Alice - Train Kept A Rollin'.flac:d2dabf7cd0cce5d591b0cd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c0d94c62e9bb4b956e8842c1425e0688b16e9f","amp;dn":"Bruce%2C+Buxton+%26+Smith_original+Alice+Cooper+members+-+One+Last+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c0d94c62e9bb4b956e8842c1425e0688b16e9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,192,217,76,98,233,187,75,149,110,136,66,193,66,94,6,136,177,110,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
