The San Ul Lim tracks are a great bonus as they are not from the Love, Peace &amp;amp; Poetry Series. Sorry, no cover scans, but MP3s are  named including country and year as per cover notes. I have some more Magognip heavy comps with cover scans to seed if this one is liked. PLEASE leave me comments.\nThanks to Magognip for letting me seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24eda1c7307d09e4efa811a42df32a4d6acb519","amp;dn":"Heavy+Meditations+%28Heavy+Prog%2C+Psych+%26+Rock+1969-1977%29+%28192%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24eda1c7307d09e4efa811a42df32a4d6acb519","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,78,218,28,115,7,208,158,78,250,129,26,66,223,50,164,214,172,181,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
