The New Age artists from the late 1960s through the mid 1980s helped shape the genre with classic New Age Synthesizer music. Garrison&amp;#039;s music is just one example of the classic New Age sound. Enjoy....\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f8120036c4def078d7f56a8dd9a7eca554443f","amp;dn":"Michael+Garrison+-+Images+%28New+Age+Synthmusic+1986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f8120036c4def078d7f56a8dd9a7eca554443f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,248,18,0,54,196,222,240,120,215,245,106,141,217,167,236,165,84,68,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
