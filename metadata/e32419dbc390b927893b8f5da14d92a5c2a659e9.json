Whereas earlier records had presented lush synths and electro beats, and future releases would feature drum n&amp;#039; bass beats with a side of ambient, this album presents full-on sumptuous ambience in the vein of Global Communication&amp;#039;s 76:14 or Brian Eno&amp;#039;s Ambient 4: On Land. Tom Thiel and Max Loderbauer are completely at the top of their game here, effortlessly generating and mixing loops for over 60 minutes into a seamless tapestry of sound. Repeating keyboard motifs, subtle percussion, and a sample from &quot;A Hard Day&amp;#039;s Night&quot; are joined together in the meticulously constructed &quot;Castor &amp; Pollux,&quot; the highlight of the concert. This is truly an ambient classic, one of the greatest of the genre, and an excellent place for those new to ambient music to start.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32419dbc390b927893b8f5da14d92a5c2a659e9","amp;dn":"sunelectric30-7-94","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32419dbc390b927893b8f5da14d92a5c2a659e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,36,25,219,195,144,185,39,137,59,143,93,161,77,146,165,194,166,89,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
