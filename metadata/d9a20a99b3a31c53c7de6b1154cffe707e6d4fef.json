For that reason and also because it's one of those non-commercial art house indie flix that are hard to find torrent sites I am offering it here. It's a high quality DivX Rip 720 x 480. I zipped up the avi file using Winrar because I have heard that doing so prevents file degradation (of the actual avi file) as it is uploaded and downloaded. Unzipping it is very simple. If you don't have Winrar go to http://www.rarlab.com/ and download the free trial. Install it and use the wizard to &quot;unpack&quot; the &quot;archive.&quot; If the file comes in the form of a series of files (eg r001, r002, etc) always choose the 1st file. This automatically unpacks the entire sequence. Anyway, if you ever download files and you see them in this sequence that means they were &quot;zipped,&quot; &quot;archived,&quot; &quot;compressed,&quot; whatever you want to call it, with Winrar. I am writing this because I often see people don't know what to do with these files. Winrar is much better than Winzip and that's why people use it instead of the more widely known latter program. I hope the instructions help. Happy downloading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a20a99b3a31c53c7de6b1154cffe707e6d4fef","amp;dn":"Wild+Parrots+of+Telegraph+Hill+%28DVD+Rip%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a20a99b3a31c53c7de6b1154cffe707e6d4fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,162,10,153,179,163,28,83,199,222,107,17,84,207,254,112,126,109,79,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
