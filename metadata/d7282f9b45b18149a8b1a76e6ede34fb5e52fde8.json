This is his autobiographical story, about his life growing up, and his journey to try and be accepted by his father. We see this story through a bizzare myriad of characters and situations, which include the eccentric Uncle Sanny, the &quot;Fat Boy Called Bitch&quot;; (John's little brother, Poochie), his mom, his evil grandmothers, and Lee Stratsberg, not to mention a brief appearance by Spike Lee as God Almighty.\n\n\n==================================\n\nalso, i have a label design for this i will be posting later on today.  The cover design i made is for a triple pack which includes John Leguizamo's &quot;Sexaholix&quot;, &quot;Mambo Mouth&quot;, and &quot;Spic-o-rama&quot; - so i am not sure if people would want that without the other dvd's (which i could start sharing within a day or two)... post comments if you want the other dvd's...\n\n\nCD Label = &lt;a href=http://daprogger.mine.nu/mlabels/j/John_leguizamo-freak_r1_English_scan_klownkillah.jpg&gt;&lt;img src=http://daprogger.mine.nu/mlabels/j/thumbJohn_leguizamo-freak_r1_English_scan_klownkillah.jpg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://daprogger.mine.nu/mlabels/j/John_leguizamo-freak_r1_English_scan_klownkillah.jpg\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7282f9b45b18149a8b1a76e6ede34fb5e52fde8","amp;dn":"John+Leguizamo+--Freak--+NTSC+%5B1998%5D+directed+by+Spike+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7282f9b45b18149a8b1a76e6ede34fb5e52fde8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,40,47,155,69,177,129,73,168,177,167,110,110,222,52,251,94,82,253,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
