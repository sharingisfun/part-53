Transcoded with StaxRip (h264/AAC).\nHebrew audio track. No subtitles.\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nEretz Nehederet is an Israeli humoristic program. The program has been broadcast since 2003. Eretz Nehederet contains humorist and actual references about the past week by imitations, jokes and so on. The program is the most successful and one of the most influential in Israel.\n\nThe program features a group of popular Israeli comedians such as Tal Friedman, Eyal Kitzis (the Jon Stewart-style host), Alma Zak, Orna Banai, Eli Finish, Mariano Idelman and Dov Navon.\n\nMuhammad Abu Tir from Hamas has expressed his discontent with the way he was represented on the program (as a party arranger who constantly invites Israelis to his parties while rolling his eyes). The Israeli politician Uzi Cohen gained a lot of popularity after he was imitated on the program, although the imitation was potentially offensive.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eretz_Nehederet)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b2c11123d460ac08122b7b71ef84f1e4cc44dd3","amp;dn":"Eretz.Nehederet.Season.3.HEBREW.DVDRIP.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b2c11123d460ac08122b7b71ef84f1e4cc44dd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,44,17,18,61,70,10,192,129,34,183,183,30,248,79,30,76,196,77,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
