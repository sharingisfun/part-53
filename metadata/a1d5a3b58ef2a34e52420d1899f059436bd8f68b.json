Number One In Security.\nFiles In Zip File:\n1. Folder Guard Professional v.7.6  (app)\n2. Folder Guard Professional v.7.6 keygen   (app)\n3. Folder Guard Professional v.7.6 (alt serial)  (text)\n4. Control Panel Hack   (text)\n5. Safe Mode Hack  (text)\n\nOK folks I had been searching for a long time for a good\nApp to lock and protect folders and files.\nI found so many that were bullshit. Some from this site\nand some from other sites.\n\nThen you have the sites were you can sometimes get the\nserial numbers and or key generators. Sometimes you get lucky,\nsometimes not. But beware when you go to these type of sites\nsuch as: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.keygen.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.keygen.us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.andr.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.andr.net&lt;/a&gt;\nyou must add these sites using wild cards In the restricted zone.\nLocated In the control panel under internet options.\nAdd wild cards like so:\n*.keygen.us\n*.andr.net\nThen use the custom settings and change file download from disable\nto enable. Do not allow any other In this zone. This will keep your\nBOX (pc)  from filling up with shit from all these web site and \nall there children.\n\nAnd then you have file sharing such as kazza and eDonkey. Some \ntimes you get lucky and get exactly what you need and some\ntimes not.\n\nWell after four hours of bull shit I got lucky. I got the best folder and\nfile security App that?s out there and on top of that Its the Latest\nversion. Folder Guard Professional v.7.6 Is the name of the app\nand this program Is great. This Is no bullshit. Serial and kegen are good.\nI just don?t want every one to be mislead by so many frauds.\nSo Here It Is for all to enjoy.\nNOTE: Make sure to add all fields to the reg box when entering serial\ncode and name.\n\nTIPS:\n1. Get to know the program\n2. Create a Folder Guard emergency rescue disk.\n4. When password protecting folders always set the attributes to\ndisable or hidden. I use disable. Password protecting only can\nbe gone around. You must password protect and select the proper\nattributes. Spend some time with the program. Get to know\nIt In and out. \n5. You can bypass Folder Guard by booting In safe mode.\nSo for 100% security you must disable safe mode boot.\nIn the Folder guard directions they don?t and will not \ntell you how to disable safe mode unless you can prove that you are\nthe true owner. In this case we cant provide them with this\ninformation. So I created my own hack for that. If done correctly\nthis hack will cause your box to crash when booting in safe mode.\nI have included directions in the zip file called &quot;Safe Mode Hack&quot;\nAlso I have included directions on hacking your control panel.\nVery useful once you learn Folder Guard.\n\nLive long and prosper,\n             Falcon3x11\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d5a3b58ef2a34e52420d1899f059436bd8f68b","amp;dn":"Folder+Guard+Professional+v.7.6+%2B+Keygen.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d5a3b58ef2a34e52420d1899f059436bd8f68b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,213,163,181,142,242,163,78,82,66,13,24,153,240,89,67,107,216,246,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
