Only 100 copies of this album were pressed originally and the members of this band went on to form B.F. Trike. The album is well crafted psychedelic folk rock, with plenty of fuzz guitar and multi-part vocal harmonies. \n\nThe BF Trike  album is the exact same trio doing essentially the same musical thing  but with a rockier edge. They even do a re-recording of Time &amp;amp; Changes from the Hickory Wind album. I highly recommend the BF Trike album as well as I personally find it a better album than this one. Enjoy!
