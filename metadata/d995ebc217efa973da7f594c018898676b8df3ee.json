Pure, intense and sometimes vulnerable and rocky at the same time.\n\nThe recipe for 'All of this is really me': \nPut Lisa Loeb, Sheryl Crow, Avril Lavigne and Coldplay in one big melting pot and combine it with Susanna's special voice and the progressive production... Et voilla!\n\nMost of the songs are written by Susanna Fields, Minco Eggersman [At the close of every day, The spirit that guides us] and Ren&amp;eacute; de Vries [This beautiful mess, Rollercoaster 23]. \n\nThis album is recorded at studio Dufry in Amsterdam and at the Mailmen studio in Utrecht. It is mastered by Martijn Groeneveld [Face tomorrow, Solo].\n\n \n1. All the same\n \n2. Sunshiny glasses\n \n3. Deepest part\n \n4. The sky behind the rain\n \n5. Underground\n \n6. Little girl\n \n7. Broken things\n \n8. Where do we go from here\n \n9. Wasted Energy\n \n10. Over the moon\n \n11. Kyrie\n \n12. Happiness belongs to me \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d995ebc217efa973da7f594c018898676b8df3ee","amp;dn":"Susanna+Fields+-+All+of+This+Is+Really+Me+%28rip+by+LP+320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d995ebc217efa973da7f594c018898676b8df3ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,149,235,194,23,239,169,115,218,127,89,76,1,136,152,103,107,141,243,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
