I only said I did it so they'd take the rat out of my anus!\n\n'Monkey Dust' is a feast of sick animation, with sketches concerning a sad-eyed man who tells wide tales about where he's been, when he's actually been doing something muckily sexual; a reality-TV series called 'People on the Toilet', where the star eventually becomes a big big star and candidate for Pope; and other such things. There's plenty of black humour, violence, and wife-swapping which turns into cannibalism.\n\nInspired humour and twisted tales make 'Monkey Dust' a must-see for fans of Jam, Spaced, and Big Train, as well as former viewers of the likes of Spitting Image.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e41ca01ae5f4a419bd9ab91516ebbd1ea28cbe","amp;dn":"Monkey_Dust_Episode1.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e41ca01ae5f4a419bd9ab91516ebbd1ea28cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,228,28,160,26,229,244,164,25,189,154,185,21,22,235,189,30,162,140,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
