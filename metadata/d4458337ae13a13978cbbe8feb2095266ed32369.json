Twelve hours after arriving in Moscow for a routine story, he has been stripped of all possessions, beaten unconscious and thrown into the KGB's political prison. Using only recovered weapons and improvised gadgets, he must now evade or overcome elite Soviet forces and defeat the conspiracy before he is sent to a Siberian prison camp or killed. \n\n\nGame Info\n\nDeveloper Mindware  \nPublisher DreamCatcher Interactive  \nGenre Action \nRelease Date September 27, 2005  \nESRB Teen for Language, Tobacco Reference, Violence  \nGameSpy Score N/A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4458337ae13a13978cbbe8feb2095266ed32369","amp;dn":"Xbox+-+RLT+-+Cold+War+%28Re-Do%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4458337ae13a13978cbbe8feb2095266ed32369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,69,131,55,174,19,161,57,120,203,190,143,235,32,149,38,110,211,35,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
