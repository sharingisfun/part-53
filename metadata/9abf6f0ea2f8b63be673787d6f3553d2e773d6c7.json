Sitting in the system tray, it monitors \nhard disks and alerts you to impending failure. The program uses \nSelf Monitoring and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) built into all new \nhard disks, and can predict failures on your hard drives. A host of alerting \nfeatures include email, local pop-up messages, net messages, and event \nlogging, while using no system resources.&quot;\n\nAnd I still know that its freeware and can be downloaded at www.pantera.com\nBut I still think people need to know about it. Maybe it rescues someone?s \ndata.\n(But the best is still regular backups)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9abf6f0ea2f8b63be673787d6f3553d2e773d6c7","amp;dn":"HDD+Health+%28freeware%2C+but+check+it%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9abf6f0ea2f8b63be673787d6f3553d2e773d6c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,191,111,14,162,248,182,59,230,115,120,125,111,53,83,210,231,115,214,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
