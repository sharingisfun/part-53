Area between Iran, Afghanistan, India and China  has\n    become the Democratic Republic of  North  Dzombystan  (DRND).  To  get\n    financial aid from United States, DRND&amp;#039;s  government  allowed  the  US\n    military to build a top-secret  subterranean  base.  But  even  DRND&amp;#039;s\n    government is unaware that the heavily fortified base  is  a  research\n    center for genetic engineering on soldiers and testing lab  for  next-\n    generation weapon systems.\n\n    When terrorist infiltrators in  the  government  learn  of  the  base,\n    signal is sent to all &quot;freedom fighters&quot; to  prepare  for  an  all-out\n    attack. A well organized  army  launches  a  coordinated  assault  and\n    swiftly advances toward the secret base. American forces guarding  the\n    base, taken by complete surprise and  vastly  outnumbered,  put  up  a\n    fierce resistance but know full-well that it is only a matter of  time\n    before they have to surrender or die fighting. With their forces  tied\n    up in crisis  areas  around  the  world,  and  no  time  to  wait  for\n    deployment of regular troops, decision is made at the highest level of\n    US government to send in the elite AEGIS rapid response team.\n\n\n\n    1 .
