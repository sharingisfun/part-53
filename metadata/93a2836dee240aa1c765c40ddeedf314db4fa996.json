After TomTom has run once, you can delete this map through the application in the &quot;Map Manager&quot; menu.\n\n-After installing the application and a map, rename Munich.bin (located on your SD card in the &quot;TomTom&quot; directory) into Munich.bin.old and copy the Munich.bin-file from the &quot;crack&quot; directory into &quot;TomTom&quot;.\n\n-Delete the &quot;START.PRC&quot; file on your expansion card in the /PALM/ directory if you DO NOT want TTN5 to start automatically whenever the card is inserted.\n\n- Copy Maps of your choice to the root of your storage card; they'll show up in TomTom's Change map option.\n\nFeel free to download and install the Palm TTN5 patch from TomTom.com. It fixes many bugs found in the previous release.\n\n\nThis archive was made possible by Bakonl (the original TTN5 cracker), and Sunray &amp; Peromni who posted &amp; reposted USA maps on alt.binaries.warez.pocketpc.gps\n\n\n-TheSmJ\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93a2836dee240aa1c765c40ddeedf314db4fa996","amp;dn":"TomTom+Nav+5+%2B+Palm+crack+%2B+USA+%26+Canada+Maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93a2836dee240aa1c765c40ddeedf314db4fa996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,162,131,109,238,36,10,161,199,101,196,13,222,237,243,20,219,79,169,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
