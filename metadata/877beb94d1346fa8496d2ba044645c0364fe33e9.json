In Boiling Point, Gelbspan argues that not only the fossil fuel industry and politicians but also the news media and environmental activists have, wittingly or otherwise, worsened the global climate crisis. In the face of all this, Gelbspan offers what he calls &quot;The World Economic Modernization Plan.&quot; In this plan, energy company presidents, economists, and energy policy experts would dramatically reduce our reliance on oil, create millions of jobs, and raise living standards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877beb94d1346fa8496d2ba044645c0364fe33e9","amp;dn":"Boiling+Point+featuring+Ross+Gelbspan+-+The+Global+Climate+Crisi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877beb94d1346fa8496d2ba044645c0364fe33e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,123,235,148,209,52,111,168,73,109,43,160,68,100,92,3,100,254,51,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
