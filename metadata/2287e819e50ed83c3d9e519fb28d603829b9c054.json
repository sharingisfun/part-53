It's      \nquite entertaining at times. Their site is at http://tkntv.thinking-kills.net/\n\nFrom the README.txt I included:\n\n&quot;Cort and Ben are two guys from Wisconsin who host an Internet broadcast\ncalled TKNTV (sometimes featuring Steve). I first found out about\nTKNTV on digg.com, and proceded to paste the url to their stream on #thevoid\n@ IRCNet.&quot;\n\nAnd about the technical stuff:\n\n&quot;These were captured from the stream with 'mplayer -dumpstream' (authors are aware\nof the capturing). I'm not quite sure what the container format is, but the codec\nis just ordinary Windows Media. It plays ok in mplayer, so if all else fails, get\nthat...&quot;\n\nSo far there's been about 5 shows and I've only missed one. I'll upload all the episodes I have once I can find the energy to make torrents :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2287e819e50ed83c3d9e519fb28d603829b9c054","amp;dn":"TKNTV%3A+Episode+1%2C+2005-09-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2287e819e50ed83c3d9e519fb28d603829b9c054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,135,232,25,229,14,216,60,61,158,81,159,178,141,96,56,41,185,192,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
