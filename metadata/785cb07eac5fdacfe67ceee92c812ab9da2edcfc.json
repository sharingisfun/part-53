Jack O&amp;#039;Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), Lt. Col. Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), and alien warrior Teal&amp;#039;c (Christopher Judge) have braved everything that the universe has thrown at them, from interstellar war and evil twins to death and ascension.\nBut changes are coming to SG-1 as it begins its ninth year of fearless service to Earth. New faces are joining the team: Maj. Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) will try to fill the very big shoes of former SG-1 leader O&amp;#039;Neill (who is now in charge in Homeworld Security), while Gen. Hank Landry (Beau Bridges) must adapt to the unique challenges of running Stargate Command, a posting unlike any other the military has to offer.\nOffworld, SG-1 might have new friends ? or new foes ? in Vala (Claudia Black), a former Goa&amp;#039;uld host turned freedom-fighter; and Gerak (Louis Gossett Jr.), a Jaffa leader who vies with Teal&amp;#039;c for political control of the new Jaffa nation.\n\n(source: www.scifi.com/stargate)\n\n\n..:: Cast ::..\n\nRichard Dean Anderson ....
