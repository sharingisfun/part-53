Sarafian\n\n# Plot Synopsis: Kowalski, the hero of the story, works for a car delivery service. He takes delivery of a 1970 Dodge Challenger to take from Colorado to Frisco, California. Shortly after pickup, he takes a bet to get the car there in less than 15 hours. After a few run-ins with motorcycle cops and highway patrol they start a chase to bring him into custody. Along the way, Kowalski is guided by Supersoul - a blind DJ with a police radio scanner. Throw in lots of chase scenes, gay hitchhikers, a naked woman riding a motorbike, lots of Mopar and you\\&amp;#039;ve got a great cult hit from the early 70\\&amp;#039;s.\n\nFull Movie...\n\nPlease Help Me Seed ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7217a269e92d973d3be7ef2a8597050083ace0","amp;dn":"Vanishing+Point+%281971%29+UK+edition+%28Divx%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7217a269e92d973d3be7ef2a8597050083ace0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,114,23,162,105,233,45,151,61,59,231,239,42,133,151,5,0,131,172,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
