It can with Replay Music!\n\nReplay Music is a unique streaming music recorder that captures MP3 files from any streaming\nsource.

You can even\nburn songs directly to CDs, or copy them to your iPod or MP3 Player. Plus, it's incredibly easy to\nuse. What a great way to discover new music!\n\n\nReplay Music records MP3s, recognizes each song, and automatically adds the artist, song title,\nalbum and genre to each MP3 file.
