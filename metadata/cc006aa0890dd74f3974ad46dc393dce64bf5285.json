The music video is hilarious. It has 80s hairstyles, bikers, weird looking sunglasses and badly choreographed fights. The video was included as the opening scene in Pia's equally hilarious film &quot;Voyage of the Rock Aliens&quot;, although it has nothing to do with the film's story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc006aa0890dd74f3974ad46dc393dce64bf5285","amp;dn":"Jermanie+Jackson+%26+Pia+Zadora+-+When+The+Rain+Begins+To+Fall.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc006aa0890dd74f3974ad46dc393dce64bf5285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,0,106,160,137,13,215,79,57,116,173,70,220,57,61,206,100,191,82,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
