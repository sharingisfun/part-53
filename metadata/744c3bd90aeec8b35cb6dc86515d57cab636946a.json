Extensive touring gave them energy and a freakout in their live sound quite unlike their peers always unfashionable and always unapologetic for it. Influenced by a real mix of bands; Hawkwind, Amon Duule 2, Can, Tangerine Dream, Jimi Hendrix, Big Black, Stooges, Velvet Underground, Pere Ubu, Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart and of course early Pink Floyd they where born in the wrong era but still die hard hippies, die hard sadly being too close to the truth as the drummer Richard Freek sadly died of alcohol abuse in 2002, following which Fast Elbert became a recluse and Mathew became a town planner  which brought an untimely end to the band.\n\nThough because of the sway of the public towards seventies prog with bands like Wolfmother,lost Johnny and CJD recently reformed for one off shows.\n\nAnyway heres the best of the MG, listen to it and you?ll be rewarded with a thousand virgins serving up chip butties on a bed of cannabis leaves in Avalon.\n\nGood luck\n\nThe Mushroom Gods are:\n\nLost Johnny        keyboard, vocals\nDick Freek         drums\nMathew Corbett     sitar, flute, effects\nFast Elbert Kram   guitar\nCJD                Bass, vocals\n \n\nif you wish to contact or more info;  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ddb0a8aeb5afb2b2b09db5b2a9b0bcb4b1f3beb2f3a8b6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:744c3bd90aeec8b35cb6dc86515d57cab636946a","amp;dn":"Mushroom+Gods+-+ive+got+an+Obi-Wan+Kenobi+and+know+one+want+to+k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"744c3bd90aeec8b35cb6dc86515d57cab636946a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,76,59,217,10,238,200,179,92,182,220,134,81,93,87,202,182,54,148,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
