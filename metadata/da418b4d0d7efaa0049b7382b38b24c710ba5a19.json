We are featuring selections from those special evenings in this Podcast. San Francisco-native Eric Levy stops by to add his unique key stylings on Slacker. The Bottom Half from 05.07 was on the receiving end of some excellent improvisation that will give the listener a much different impression of that song than the version from Podcast #4. The frenetic ending of Mulche's from 05.06 is followed by All In Time, one of the band's most immediately recognizable tunes. \n\nPodcast #7 (07.01.05) - April 2005 part 3 \n00:00 - In the Kitchen &gt; \n12:19 - The Crooked One &gt; \n20:46 - In the Kitchen (04.13.05 - Newport Music Hall, Columbus, Ohio) \n22:35 - Thin Air^ (04.29.05 - Orpheum Theatre, New Orleans, Louisiana) \n36:39 - Jazz Odyssey &gt; \n40:21 - KaBump &gt; \n53:07 - Resolution* &gt; \n65:20 - 40's Theme (04.30.05 - Tipitina's Uptown, New Orleans, Louisiana) \nTotal Broadcast Length 75:12 \nNotes: \n^ with Warren Haynes on guitar \n* with Nothing Too Fancy tease \n\nTo finish out our feature on April, here are a few more tasty selections. The highlight is the appearance of guitarist-of-all-trades Warren Haynes lending his stylings to Thin Air. The Jazz Fest late-night medley closes out the broadcast. Even though they were just getting warmed up, they opened with some smooth playing that culminates in the frenzied finish of 40's Theme. \n\nPodcast #6 (06.15.05) - April 2005 part 2 \n00:00 - August* &gt; \n10:50 - Jazz Odyssey &gt; \n17:20 - Utopian Fir &gt; \n34:07 - Passing (04.15.05 - Canopy Club, Urbana, Illinois) \n38:03 - Nemo &gt; \n40:17 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;^ &gt; \n46:04 - Nemo (04.08.05 - Egyptian Room, Indianapolis, IN) \n48:16 - Q*Bert &gt; \n53:30 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; &gt; \n60:10 - Hajimemashite &gt; \n64:21 - Water &gt; \n69:32 - Peter Gunn Theme/Every Breath You Take &gt; \n70:59 - Water &gt; \n73:01 - Peter Gunn Theme/Every Breath You Take &gt; \n74:09 - Water (04.13.05 - Newport Music Hall, Columbus, OH) \nTotal Broadcast Length 76:24 \nNotes: \n* with Blackbird (The Beatles) bass intro and a brief Stairway to Heaven (Led Zeppelin) tease \n^ with vocals \n\nThere was some very powerful jams and gorgeous flowing medleys of tunes in early April as well. The &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; in the middle of Nemo is beautiful, many fans are hoping that this makes its way into a new song, much like the chorus to Believe the Lie. The ebb and flow of moving into and out of Water demonstrate the band's ability to shift directions and moods. Also featured is the new tune Passing, which debuted for the first time on 3.26.05 \n\nPodcast #5 (06.01.05) - April 2005 part 1 \n00:00 - Der Bluten Kat* &gt; \n22:39 - Bron-Yr-Aur &gt; \n24:11 - Der Bluten Kat (04.02.05 - La Zona Rosa, Austin, Texas) \n28:03 - Padgett's Profile &gt; \n31:40 - How Many More Times?** &gt; \n33:18 - Padgett's Profile (04.06.06 - Temple Club, Lansing, Michigan) \n41:18 - Robot World &gt; \n44:23 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;$ &gt; \n52:43 - Mail Package &gt; \n58:10 - Immigrant Song^ (04.16.05 - The Rave, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) \n59:11 - Front Porch$$ (04.07.05 - Intersection, Grand Rapids, Michigan) \nTotal Broadcast Length 75:15 \nNotes: \n* with Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin) jam \n** one verse \n$ with Crazy Train (Ozzy Osbourne) jam and improvised lyrics \n$$ with Kashmir (Led Zeppelin) and Kinky Reggae (Bob Marley) jams \n\nUmphrey's McGee likes Led Zeppelin. If the influence wasn't apparent to you, maybe this podcast will help you out. They just seemed to be busting out major Zeppelin passages over the first few weeks of April, so here they are. Lots of exploratory segments in this Podcast, that give a better feel for what the band does when they stretch the limits of a song. \n\nPodcast #4 (05.15.05) - Jam in the Dam \n00:00 - We're Going to War &gt; \n04:50 - The Bottom Half \n10:40 - Push the Pig* \n19:46 - Syncopated Strangers \n31:21 - Trenchtown Rock^ (03.21.05 - The Old Hall, Melkweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands) \n37:45 - Visions of Parin &gt; \n43:58 - Plunger (03.20.05 - The Max, Melkweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands) \n49:56 - Ringo^^ (03.22.05 - The Old Hall, Melkweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands) \n62:38 - Roulette (03.26.05 - The Riviera, Chicago, Illinois) \nTotal Broadcast Length 77:11 \nNotes: \n* with Lose Yourself (Eminem) teases \n^ with Keller Williams on vocals, woodblock \n^^ with Charlie Hitchcock (Particle) on guitar \n\nHere is a collection of tunes from Jam in the Dam. The band was loose, relaxed, and very playful. All of the bands were having a blast; you can hear the mutual respect among the artists during the Keller Williams and Charlie Hitchcock sit-ins. To close out this collection of tunes is the Roulette from their triumphant return to The Riviera, a few highlights. You can feel the band and the crowd feeding off each other's energy. \n\nPodcast #3 (05.01.05) - early March 2005 \n00:00 - Divisions - (03.07.05 - Exit/In, Nashville, Tennessee) \n19:56 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;^* - (03.11.05 - Variety Playhouse, Atlanta, Georgia) \n31:04 - explanation of the title for Miss Tinkle's Overture \n33:30 - Miss Tinkle's Overture \n42:08 - FF &gt; \n45:08 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot;^ &gt; \n50:28 - Walletsworth (03.09.05 - WorkPlay, Birmingham, Alabama) \n55:37 - Jimmy Stewart&quot;^ (03.08.05 - Blue Cats, Knoxville, Tennessee) \n63:39 - Hurt Bird Bath** - (03.09.05 - WorkPlay, Birmingham, Alabama) \nTotal Broadcast Length 79:52 \nNotes: \n^ with improvised vocals \n* with Napoleon Dynamite theme teases \n** with Peter Gunn theme teases and Paradise City (Guns N' Roses) jam \n\nThe band's week long tour through the south yielded some gem &quot;Jimmy Stewarts&quot; that everyone should check out. Each of the three &quot;Stewarts&quot; in this episode are of the rare lyrical variety. The Atlanta and Knoxville &quot;Stewarts&quot; could easily be confused as songs to the untrained listener. The Pearl Jam-tinged Birmingham &quot;Stewart&quot; is a nice treat for the children of the 90s in us all. The explanation of the title for Miss Tinkle's Overture gives us at least a little bit of insight into the band's song naming conventions (unconventional as they are). For those unfamiliar with the &quot;Jimmy Stewart,&quot; be sure to check out this write-up. \n\nPodcast #2 (04.15.05) - February 2005 \n00:00 - Believe the Lie (02.25.05 - Fox Theatre, Boulder, Colorado) \n07:21 - Tribute to the Spinal Shaft &gt; \n14:37 - &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; &gt; \n25:40 - Hajimemashite &gt; \n30:41 - White Man's Moccasins (02.18.05 - Barrymore Theatre, Madison, Wisconsin) \n37:22 - Ocean Billy (02.26.05 - Fox Theatre, Boulder, Colorado) \n48:26 - Nothing Too Fancy &gt; \n70:07 - Sociable Jimmy (02.16.05 - IMU Ballroom, Iowa City, Iowa) \nTotal Broadcast Length 78:57 \n\nThe touring year opened with the band feeling relaxed and eager to stretch the boundaries. Believe the Lie is one of the newest additions to the UM repertoire, is and an example of the band's use of &quot;Jimmy Stewarts&quot; to write new songs. The chorus initially appeared as an improvisation during Der Bluten Kat from 02.11.04. Debuting on 02.16.05, it has quickly become a crowd pleaser. Also featured, the improvisation in the &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; (02.18.05) as well as the second half of Nothing Too Fancy (02.16.05) show the band's ability to create wave upon wave of momentum to drive the crowd into a veritable frenzy. \n\nPodcast #1 (04.05.05) - Best of 2004 \n00:00 - In the Kitchen (02.05.04 - Cervante's, Denver, Colorado) \n10:36 - Nemo (10.21.04 - Key Club, Los Angeles, California) \n15:08 - The Triple Wide &gt; \n27:14 - 2nd Self (12.11.04 - 9:30 Club, Washington, DC) \n32:41 - The Pequod &gt; \n34:24 - Ahab &gt; \n36:11 - The Pequod (08.07.04 - Skyline Stage, Chicago, Illinois) \n36:57 - Blue Echo &gt; \n46:19 - Bridgeless (04.02.04 - Egyptian Room, Indianapolis, Indiana) \n56:21 - Women Wine and Song^ (12.31.04 - The Riviera, Chicago, Illinois) \n60:02 - Wife Soup^^ (02.21.04 - Funk Box, Baltimore, Maryland) \nTotal Broadcast Length 75:15 \nNotes: \n^ with horns \n^^ with Joshua Redman \n\nThis selection is a version of the Best of 2004 Compilation that was put together for use as a promotional CD to be passed out to record stores and bars.
