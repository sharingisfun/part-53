Kick-ass riffs, large amount of excellent solos and good vocals (not the contemporary mallcorish nu-metal crap growling) make this album 100% pure headbanging fun. My favourite 2004 Thrash Metal album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c74e105f31c6786a7aa6ff9479d3d2638aa7feb8","amp;dn":"Blistered+Earth+-+Blistered+Earth+%282004%29+%40VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c74e105f31c6786a7aa6ff9479d3d2638aa7feb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,78,16,95,49,198,120,106,122,166,255,148,121,211,210,99,138,167,254,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
