Keep in mind that\nthis is a Work In Progress (WIP) version. This version is compiled with Visual Studio .net 2003 and the XDK.\nFurther some files didn't transfer here but I didn't have any problems with StepMania. These files are still\nincluded but aren't transfered cause of the FatX system that only supports filenames upto 40 characters. If\nanyone find a solution for this that would be great !\n\n(sidenote by Iriez) I've included the supported files provided by tvstatic so that no files should error when\ntransfering. I also added the sample song from Xport's previous build to get you new stepmania users going.(/sidenote)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKnown issues, limitations and differences from the PC/Linux/Mac version:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n - Characters don't seem to be appearing\n - Movie and Visualisation support has not been implented\n - Packages implentation is broken\n - No USB keybourd support\n\n---------------------------------------\nAdvantages of StepManiaX (by Xport) v5:\n---------------------------------------\n\n - Virtual Memory Managment has been implented\n - Profile names can be typed with the Xbox controller\n - IP Adresses (for SMLan) can be typed in with the Xbox controller\n - Controls can now be mapped using the Xbox controller\n - Limited song editing is now supported with the Xbox controller\n - Themes are working ? (see below)\n - Faster loading\n - Possible 128MB RAM fix (needs testing)\n\n-------------------------\nVirtual Memory Managment:\n-------------------------\n\nVirtual Memory Managment (VMM) has been implented on this version with on-demand paging. This should solve\nmost but not all out of memory problems that occur. Out of memory errors can still occur becuase textures\nloaded by StepMania (using Direct3D) are not loaded into the virtual memory and thus cannot be managed by\nthe Virtual Memory Manager. So, if too many textures are loaded you can still get out of memory errors.\n\nYou can edit the settings of the VMM in the file: Stepmania.ini that is found in /data/. This file is created\nwhen Stepmania first run. Here is where the settings are:\n\nUnder [Options]:\n EnableVirtualMemory\t- Enabled by default; set it to 0 to disable, 1 to enable\n PageFileSize\t\t- default is 384; this is the size of the file in MegaBytes\n PageSize\t\t- default is 16; this is the file of a single page in KiloBytes\n PageThresHold\t\t- default is 8; this is the minimum size in KiloBytes for an allocation to be \n\t\t\t\t\tmanaged by the Virtual Memory Manager\n\nUnder [Debug]:\n LogVirtualMemory\t- disabled by default; when enabled it writes to the log every allocation, \n\t\t\t\t\t       deallocation and page swap during execution. Set to 0 to\n\t\t\t\t\t       disable, 1 to enable\n\n-------------------------------\nXbox Controller keyboard input:\n-------------------------------\n\nStepMania is now accepting keyboard input using the Xbox controller. This allows you to create profiles, \nconnect to SMLan servers and to map the controls. The controls for input are as follows:\n\nTyping (Profile names, IP Adresses):\n D-Pad up/down \t- Select nex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0082686f568bbd4b64c59d8e932396e2a762c989","amp;dn":"StepMania+3.9+RC2a+X1+-+XBOX+Compiled+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0082686f568bbd4b64c59d8e932396e2a762c989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,130,104,111,86,139,189,75,100,197,157,142,147,35,150,226,167,98,201,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
