Did you think we weren&amp;#039;t\n  gonna call you??? ;)\n\n  So, Finally - Something New!\n\n  Here you go, hot of the Aquasonic presses, a brand new mix from some of\n  our favouite track from new and not so new.  Starting on a progressive\n  tip with the dark, tribal melody of Yunus, we build layer on layer with\n  the tougher sound of RPO, the bleak bleep of Floppy Sounds and The Flash\n  Brothers ethnic bazaar of rhythm.  We calm it with Pole Folder and CP&amp;#039;s \n  lushness into Nooncats spikey melody and filtered chords, with a topping\n  of Eric Prydz far better side in Pryda&amp;#039;s The Gift.  So now you&amp;#039;re all \n  chilled and relaxed we figured we wanted to slowly get you on your feet.\n  Squared acid from John Tejada, pulsing organ techno with Joris Voorn, \n  the minimal percussion of Gasier leading to the ride cymbal hammering of\n  Pig and Dan&amp;#039;s heavy Pusher. From here it&amp;#039;s all up, more RPO, the hard\n  rave like sound of Alexander Kowalski and finishing you off with another\n  pounding acid number from the master - Rob Acid.  From one dark side of \n  dance to another via the occasional guiding light of melody - welcome to\n  our new mix, and enjoy your trip :)\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n  Group Info:                                                             \n                                                                          \n  Aquasonic DJs have been playing out for the last 12 years, in various   \n  forms of music from techno, d&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;b, breaks and more.
