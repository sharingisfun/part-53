This release is the sort of stuff most labels are afraid to pick up, and that is exactly why aCb felt it should be released. Just because it doesnt prescribe to the latest trendy IDM geometry of the moment does not mean that Phluidbox's spiritually deep concoctions should be hidden. In fact, it gives more reason for us to behold in the beauty of true artistry in  the metaphysical wave manipulation realm that both 'thos grol' and Phluidbox reside.\n\nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs-NonCommercial 1.0 license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\n\nThus, you are free to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work under\nthe following conditions:\n\n- Attribution.
