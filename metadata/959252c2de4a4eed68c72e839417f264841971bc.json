Three years later he would find himself on a life support machine with\nhis band about to go out on their first major tour alongside Razorlight and The\nKillers.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When you come face-to-face with death it changes the way you face up things,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nhe muses now. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You can run but you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hide and I suppose this record is what\nit sounds like to face all your demons and deal with your emotions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Indeed, The\nBoxer Rebellion is the sound of a fiery battle ground.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re crying out for substance in music, The Boxer Rebellion are here to\nsooth your soul,&amp;quot; Kerrang\n\nThe years in between saw a chance meeting between Nicholson and guitarist, Todd\nHowe, at LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 12 Bar Club soon cemented into a firm friendship. Living and\nwriting together, the duo caught the attention of bassist, Adam Harrison and\ndrummer Piers Hewitt - friends from college, who completed the line-up.\n\nIn June 2003 The Boxers bolstered their way onto GlastonburyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New Bands tent\nvia a Playlouder competition ahead of some unknowns called Keane. Snapped up by\nAlan McGee before the enormity of what they were doing had even registered, they\nspent months in the studio rehearsing and writing before disaster struck again\nfor Nicholson.\n\nFloored by stomach cramps, riders were swapped for saline drips as Nathan left\nbehind the sweaty British tour circuit for a hospital bed and a twelve hour\noperation to remove a life-threatening growth from his stomach. He was lucky.\nThe band was unlucky.\n\nRecovery was to take up the first quarter of 2004, but the band soon regained\ntheir footing and went into the Jacobs in Surrey with Chris Sheldon (Foo\nFighters, Oceansize). If only it was that easy. With the album deadline looming,\nlarge chunks of tape were binned as the boys retreated to The Bunker in Chiswick\nwith Mark Robinson who had done their original demos to try and capture more of\ntheir true sound. What emanated from these sessions was the raw, visceral drone\nrock monster they had become loved for. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“pathological noise-rush warfare not\nheard since the old school mentalism of Richard Ashcroft,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to quote NME.\n\nWith a mammoth UK tour supporting Biffy Clyro completed at the end of 2004, The\nBoxer Rebellion kick off 2005 on the Jim Beam Music Tour alongside The\nRaveonettes and Dogs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:959252c2de4a4eed68c72e839417f264841971bc","amp;dn":"The+Boxer+Rebellion-Exits-%28Advance%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"959252c2de4a4eed68c72e839417f264841971bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,146,82,194,222,74,78,237,104,199,46,131,148,23,242,100,132,25,113,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
