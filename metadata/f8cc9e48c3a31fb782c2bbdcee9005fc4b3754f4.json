A huge jump forward from its predecessor and other existing systems, CAT2 combines all the powerful capabilities of the previous versions plus key enhancements, including:\n\nNew Rig Manipulation system ? With F/IK?, just push the character into the pose you want. No extra windows. No fuss.\nFoot Pivot System ? Position and animate the foot pivot without complication or limitation.\nStretchy Bones Mode ? Drag the length of individual bones in the viewport with the mouse. Animate the scale of all rig bones, including spines, with no skewing ? perfect for cartoon-style characters and facial rigs.\nTime Warp Curves ? Control the velocity of a whole animation layer with a single spline curve. The Matrix-like bullet-time effects were never easier!\nExtra Bones ? Create more bones to be used as facial bones, stomach bones, weapon bones, etc. Create and attach whole facial rigs to a character rig.\nEdit Rig Mesh ? Create the perfect proxy mesh, and then save it as a rig preset for reuse.\nMotion Data Importing ? Import motion data files in HTR, BVH, FBX and BIP formats.\n\nCredits Team 4DNinja  :)\n\n&amp; TGN (the gorilla network)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8cc9e48c3a31fb782c2bbdcee9005fc4b3754f4","amp;dn":"3ds.Max8.CAT.Character.Animation.Toolkit.v2.11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8cc9e48c3a31fb782c2bbdcee9005fc4b3754f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,204,158,72,195,163,31,183,130,194,187,220,238,144,5,252,75,55,84,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
