Beautifully recorded by engineer Jan Erik Kongshaug, this out of print ECM LP is well worth seeking.\n\nTracks\n\t1 \t  \tSilver \tKuhn \t8:49\n  \t  \t2 \t  \tPrelude in G \tKuhn \t4:26\n  \t  \t3 \t  \tUlla \tKuhn \t7:23\n  \t  \t4 \t  \tThoughts of a Gentleman/The Saga of Harrison Crabfeathers \tKuhn \t12:16\n  \t  \t5 \t  \tLife's Backward Glance \tKuhn \t4:45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d80b5ec3bfeee99a784ea25de35c71e06182c1","amp;dn":"JAZZ-+Steve+Kuhn-+Ecstasy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d80b5ec3bfeee99a784ea25de35c71e06182c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,216,11,94,195,191,238,233,154,120,78,162,93,227,92,113,224,97,130,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
