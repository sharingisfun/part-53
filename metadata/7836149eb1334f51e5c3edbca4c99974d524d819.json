And  any  animation  can  even  be  saved  as  a\n     screensaver.\n\n\n     Xara  has  pioneered  technology  to  create  the highest quality\n     onscreen  results,  with compact file sizes - ideal for web pages\n     and presentations.\n\n     Traditional  3D  programs  are  notoriously  difficult to use and\n     understand.  Not  so  Xara3D. Unlike much modern 'bloatware' that\n     offers  more  features  than are ever likely to be used, and take\n     an  age  to  learn  and  understand,  Xara3D  has been created to\n     perform  one  job,  and  performs that job with style, speed, and\n     slick simplicity.\n\n     Xara3D  is  solely designed to create the highest quality 3D text\n     and  graphics,  such as logos, titles, headings and buttons. It's\n     the  perfect  way  to add impact to your web pages, mailshots and\n     presentations   (all  images  are  fully  anti-aliased  for  that\n     smooth,  professional quality). Xara3D can also create awesome 3D\n     animations  in  seconds  -  GIFs,  AVIs  and  simple  Flash movie\n     sequences  -  and you can even enhance your desktop by saving any\n     animation as a screensaver!\n\n     http://www.xara.com/products/xara3d/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7836149eb1334f51e5c3edbca4c99974d524d819","amp;dn":"Xara+3D+v6+00-ArCADE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7836149eb1334f51e5c3edbca4c99974d524d819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,54,20,158,177,51,79,81,229,195,237,188,164,201,153,116,213,36,216,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
