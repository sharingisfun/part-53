Sure it's short in\n          length, but it is so full of good music that what it lacks in quantity it makes up   \n          for in quality. The song 'Jailbreak' is AC/DC at it's best with Bon Scott's unique   \n          and edgy vocals. Angus Young's guitar work is phenominal. 'You Aint' Got A Hold on   \n          Me' shows where the band is heading with a more melodic rhythm and catchy chorus, and\n          'Soul Stripper' shows where the band came from, with a really great blues vocal by   \n          Bon. Another highlight of 'Jailbreak' is the cover of Them/Van Morrison's tune 'Baby \n          Please Don't Go'. The instantly recognizable guitar hook is great, and AC/DC takes   \n          this classic and makes it their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38172fedcc24766e5f5d8261b7de10f24892304f","amp;dn":"ACDC-74_Jailbreak_Remastered-%28Retail%29-2003-HHI.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38172fedcc24766e5f5d8261b7de10f24892304f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,23,47,237,204,36,118,110,95,93,130,97,183,222,16,242,72,146,48,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
