Horror\n\nSYNOPSIS: &quot;The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms&quot; is one of many &quot;nuclear explosion thaws out the pre-historic monster&quot; movies popular in the 1950&amp;#039;s. What sets this film apart from other similarly themed films, are the superior special effects created by the legendary Ray Harryhausen.\n\nHis dinosaur is as good as you will see in any sci-fi movie. It moves without that jerky motion common in so many stop-motion monsters (i.e. King Kong). The &quot;monster destroys the city&quot; sequence is outstanding. There is also an excellent fight between an octopus and a shark that is very exciting. The best sequence takes place at the end of the film when the monster is cornered in an amusement park.\n\nAs in all such movies, the human actors are incidental to the plot. The German/Swiss actor Paul Christian (aka Hubschmid) plays the requisite scientist, Paula Raymond and Cecil Kellaway are the &quot;dinosaur experts and Kenneth Tobey and Donald Woods play the sceptical military types. There are also a number of recognizable &quot;B&quot; movie faces from the period such as Lee Van Cleef, Steve Brodie, Jack Pennick and James Best.\n\nAUDIO (CODEC):Dolby Digital Mono\n\nFORMAT (PAL O NTSC): Pal\n\nIDIOMA: Spanish, English, German, French\n\nSUBTÃƒï¿½TLES: EspaÃƒÂ±ol, InglÃƒÂ©s, AlemÃƒÂ¡n, FrancÃƒÂ©s, PortuguÃƒÂ©s, IslandÃƒÂ©s, Sueco, Croata, Esloveno, Griego, HÃƒÂºngaro, Rumano, Holandes, Turco, Ãƒï¿½rabe, InglÃƒÂ©s para sordos, AlemÃƒÂ¡n para sordos\n\n\nIMAGE: 1.37:1 , 4:3\n\nEXTRAS: Interactive menus, trailers, Direct access to scenes, Make off, Harryhausen y Bradhury: An unfathomable friendship, Other fantastic creatures of Willis H.
