This new work exposes the connections between the Bohemian Club and Skull and Bones and other occult secret societies. Jones explores the roots of the Grove and its links to occult networks dating back to ancient Egypt and Babylon. \n\nThis new 40 plus minute film delves deeply into the history of the Grove where powerful men make decisions that affect the world but are completely hidden from public scrutiny. The Order of Death details how the Grove has been the backdrop for some of the most earthshattering events in human history including the development of the Starwars program and the Manhattan Project.\n\nJones' newest forray into revealing the occult also had him butting heads with local protesters of the Grove who, like the owl-worshippers inside, try to conceal their own occult practices.\n\nThe Order of Death also features never before seen footage captured by a daring former Grove employee including an astounding look inside the owl worshiped at the Cremation of Care ritual.\n\nThe Order of Death will be included in an upcoming Special Editon of &quot;Dark Secrets: Inside the Bohemian Grove&quot;.\n\nRuntime......: app: 40 min.\nVideo Codec..: Windows Media Video\nVideo Bitrate: ?
