It is intended as an initial toolbox for techs who have experience with Windows and malware removal. Don't use this disc if you have no idea how to do these things.\n\nI don't plan on keeping this disc publicly up to date, nor will I even update it often privately. Should any members of the community wish to take this disc to expand it, keep it up to date, and write tutorials then go for it. It could become a very useful tool.\n\nThe disc contains lots of tools from Sysinternals, Hijack This, various anti-* software, and Zone Alarm. Good enough for a start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaef6dea86a14b536b2e2586b7a93b6617ecab93","amp;dn":"Anti+Spyware+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaef6dea86a14b536b2e2586b7a93b6617ecab93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,239,109,234,134,161,75,83,107,46,37,134,183,169,59,102,23,236,171,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
