I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named &quot;b2pilot187&quot;. Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be setled sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; (and now &quot;Alex Jones&quot; too) and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nReVIsed alias Masterpiece\n\nSynopsis:\n\ngsfjr77 wrote:\n\n&quot;This 32min video is the most concise report on 9/11 that I have yet seen.
