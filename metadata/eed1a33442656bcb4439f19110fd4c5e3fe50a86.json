While his psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges),is baffled by this cheerfully confident man, ProtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s descriptions of life on a planet 1000 light years away awaken a sense of possibility among the other patients. When Prot says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going back before the summer ends, all the patients on the ward vie to go with him. As the days before ProtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s announced departure from earth race by, Dr. Powell struggles with questions of science versus faith and wonders about his own ability to distinguish reality from delusion.\n\n\t \t\nIMdb or Movie link: \thttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272152/\n  \n\t\t\thttp://www.k-pax.com/\n\nVideo..............: PAL 720x576 (88% DVD Shrink)\nAudio .............: English,Dolby Digital 5.1  \nMenu...............: Yes (90%) \nExtras:............: No \nSubtitles:.........: English,Danish,Swedish,Norwegian,Finnish,Icelandic\nRuntime..........: 1 hr. 58 min\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed1a33442656bcb4439f19110fd4c5e3fe50a86","amp;dn":"K-PAX.PAL.NORDIC.DVD-R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed1a33442656bcb4439f19110fd4c5e3fe50a86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,209,163,52,66,101,107,203,68,57,241,145,16,253,76,94,63,229,10,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
