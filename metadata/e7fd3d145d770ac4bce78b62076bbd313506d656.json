His campaign was   \n going very well, until a misunderstanding between Earl and a police officer\n was caught on tape and broadcast as the opposing candidate's campaign      \n commercial. Now Earl submits his father's name to run again, even though   \n Carl is adamant that he does not want to be mayor. Earl, Randy, and        \n Catalina recruit unregistered voters to boost Carl's numbers, hoping to win\n not only the election for Carl, but also a relationship with his father for\n Earl.                                                                      \n\n series url : http://www.tv.com/show/31988/summary.html?q=My+Name+is+Earl\n episode url: http://www.tv.com/episode/497161/summary.html\n\nGROUP NEWS\n \n -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7fd3d145d770ac4bce78b62076bbd313506d656","amp;dn":"My.Name.Is.Earl.S01E09.HDTV.XviD-XOR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7fd3d145d770ac4bce78b62076bbd313506d656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,253,61,20,93,119,10,196,188,231,139,98,7,107,189,49,53,6,214,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
