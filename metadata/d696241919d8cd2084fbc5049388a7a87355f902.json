It will fit on a 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nIf you want to play in the proper aspect ratio use the little programme included it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin &amp;amp; cue files.\n\nIf you have nero installed then it has a box you can tick to burn it to NTSC(american video standard)\n\nIf you want to get more stuff like this come and join www.punktorrents.com and feel free to say hi.\n\nIf you like the things i post please use the fast reply box to say thanks.
