All of the favourites make an appearance, Tubbs and Edward, Pauline, Geoff, Herr Lipp, Bernice, papa lazarou and the Dentons.\n\nThe new sketches are brilliant, especially the sketch called 'Scott', which I imagine was omitted from the series because it wouldn't fit in the world that is Roysten Vasey. Herr Lipp with his many innuendos,is absolutely hilarious, but i'm sure the poor audience member won't say so! The gents are on top form, especially Reece Shearsmith, who is very much a physical actor. He is especially brilliant as Papa Lazarou.\n\nlive at Drury lane is a fantastic sketch show that I would recommend to any League of Gentlemen fan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b7f51fd2b970517aace1861e918b089028e7adc","amp;dn":"The+League+Of+Gentlemen+Live+At+Drury+Lane+%28DomZ+%2B+KitCh%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b7f51fd2b970517aace1861e918b089028e7adc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,127,81,253,43,151,5,23,170,206,24,97,233,24,176,137,2,142,122,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
