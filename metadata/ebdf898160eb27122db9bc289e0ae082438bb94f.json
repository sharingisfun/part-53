Their two albums, both released in 1970, were extremely influenced by early Led Zeppelin, and to a lesser degree other heavy British and American rock groups from the end of the '60s. Blues-rock formed much of the base; Pete Bailey's high tortured vocals owed much to the Robert Plant school, and the songs were built around crunching riffs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebdf898160eb27122db9bc289e0ae082438bb94f","amp;dn":"Josefus+-+Dead+Man+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebdf898160eb27122db9bc289e0ae082438bb94f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,223,137,129,96,235,39,18,45,185,188,40,158,10,224,130,67,139,185,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
