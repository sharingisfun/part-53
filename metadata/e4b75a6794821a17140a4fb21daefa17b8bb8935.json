Their only album was released privately whilst the band was based in Holland so effectively this is a Dutch only release hence the reason some people have assumed the band was Dutch. Furious extreme loud psych rock with an armada of blistering guitars.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - FE\n\nThis is really raw hard rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not as professional sounding as I was hoping, but an excellent addition to any rarities collection, and contains some of the grungiest fuzz guitar I have heard. \nEnjoy!
