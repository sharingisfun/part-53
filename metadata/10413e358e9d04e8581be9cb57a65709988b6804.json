With fresh blood in the band, Beseech began writing \n  new material and quickly the tracks took shape becoming more mature and \n  complex than ever before. Following a 6-month recording period, &quot;Sunless \n  Days&quot; finally saw the light. \n\n  This is the limited digipack edition with two bonus tracks.
