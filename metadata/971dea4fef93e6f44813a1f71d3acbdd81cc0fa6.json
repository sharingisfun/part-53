Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Tucker Carlson&lt;p&gt;\n\nGuest via satellite: Gov. Mike Huckabee&lt;p&gt;\n\nOther Guest: Jose Canseco&lt;p&gt;\n\nThe video quality is great the whole time this time. Enjoy.&lt;p&gt;\n\nLast time, people wondered what codecs I used - it's DivX, and the audio is Microsoft ADPCM. Sorry if the codecs cause any problems, but I'm using proprietary software for my DVR card and these were the best options available.&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Please consider &lt;a href=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/knuckle50/torrents.html&gt;donating&lt;/a&gt; to keep this effort going. I need a new hard drive, because this one is almost full and is corrupt and about to go. I also need new cables, and if I get enough donations for them, quality of the uploads will be greatly increased. I will be uploading all the episodes this season (and maybe longer) if I can keep my computer going. Thanks.&lt;/b&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971dea4fef93e6f44813a1f71d3acbdd81cc0fa6","amp;dn":"Real+Time+with+Bill+Maher+Season+3+Episode+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971dea4fef93e6f44813a1f71d3acbdd81cc0fa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,29,234,79,239,147,230,244,72,19,161,247,29,58,203,221,129,204,15,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
