The performance was recorded by Al Kooper, and was likely intended for an official live album. A few recording anomalies (the guitar hitting Paul's mic stand and tape saturation) likely commanded a veto from the CBS Records executives. It's a shame, because, aside from a few recording baubles, the show is certainly worth an official release. Of special note are the performances of &quot;Overs,&quot; &quot;At The Zoo,&quot; &quot;Leaves That Are Green,&quot; &quot;The Dangling Conversation,&quot; and &quot;Old Friends / Bookends.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9710a58dcc07e92910a6f752ec1a014e3b53db7","amp;dn":"simon+%26+garfunkel+Live+at+the+Hollywood+Bowl%2C+Hollywood%2C+CA%2C+23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9710a58dcc07e92910a6f752ec1a014e3b53db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,113,10,88,220,192,126,146,145,10,111,117,46,193,160,20,227,181,61,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
