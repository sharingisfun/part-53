A true find for anyone into Idiot Flesh, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum etc etc.\n\nThis is the first Idiot Flesh release I know of, and different in some cases from the formally known Idiot Flesh releases. Although the music is the same, you can feel where they experimented; some experiments went on to be standards for the band, other experiments seem to have died with this initial release.\n\nIf you have never heard of Idiot Flesh, I suggest you download if you like any of the following: Art Metal, Goth Rock, Noise, experimental, industrial or any of the like.\n\nI will seed until my eyes bleed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11da091e77956d9b6d90e3d91651d569e1c27006","amp;dn":"Idiot+Flesh+-+Tales+of+Instant+Knowledge+and+Sure+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11da091e77956d9b6d90e3d91651d569e1c27006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,218,9,30,119,149,109,155,109,144,227,217,22,81,213,105,225,194,112,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
