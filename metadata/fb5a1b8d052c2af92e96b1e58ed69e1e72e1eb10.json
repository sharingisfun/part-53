The Healer \n\nThe &quot;Crying For Help&quot; tracks were originally intended to be one piece of music. The plan was to write a 'Theme and Variations' which were integral to themselves, both musically and conceptually. At a later point, it was decided to use separate parts of this composition to act as musical interludes between larger and more intense songs on their two first albums, &quot;Songs From The Lions Cage&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot;. \n\nWith this mini album the band have taken the opportunity to put the tracks back together again, whilst using this chance to expand, change and create fresh material. &quot;The Cry&quot; also features a song called &quot;The Healer&quot; written to be the final part of the &quot;Crying For Help&quot; series. \n\nRipped at 224kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5a1b8d052c2af92e96b1e58ed69e1e72e1eb10","amp;dn":"Arena+-+The+Cry%28more+awesome+heavy+prog%2Fsymph+rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5a1b8d052c2af92e96b1e58ed69e1e72e1eb10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,90,27,141,5,44,42,249,46,150,177,229,142,214,158,30,114,225,235,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
