By choosing from a list of available content on your TV screen (each with its own a preview image/video and map details), you will simply select the one you want to play and it will download and install itself to your Xbox! That's how easy it will be to get the latest and greatest modded content for your Live! enabled games. Sound familiar? That's right, its just as easy as getting 'official' content from the Live! service. Only difference is that this content was built by fellow modders in the Xbox community, oh yeah, and its free!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c0d87084c3eb15b27052b7c700d59890d8433b5","amp;dn":"Mimesis+%3A%3A+Public+Release+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c0d87084c3eb15b27052b7c700d59890d8433b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,13,135,8,76,62,177,91,39,5,43,124,112,13,89,137,13,132,51,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
