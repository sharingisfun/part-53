The original one is the\none you hear in this mp3.  I own two\nGoonies CDs, one is a soundtrack of\nsongs, the other is the music.\n\nThe music was RE-RECORDED, and it is\nnot the original that we all heard\nin the movie.  Nobody owns the actual\nsoundscore, even if you think you do,\nyou don't, trust me on this.  If you\nhave the soundscore, where is Data's\ntheme on that?  Exactly my point.\n\nI have extracted every second of audio\nfrom the opening of the movie to the\nlast credits.  I am in the process of\nsplitting up the entire set on two CDs.\n\nThere will be at least 25 tracks total\nand I am guessing near 40 or so.  It\nwill look something like this.....\n\nHere is the first five minutes of track\ninformation for my CD.\n\n01 - Dialogue - Jailbreak\n02 - Goonies Theme #1\n03 - I Got Nothing\n04 - Goonies Theme #2\n05 - Dialogue - Mouth's House\n06 - Goonies Theme #3\n07 - Data's Theme\n08 - Goonies Theme #4\n09 - Dialogue - 4 Wheel Drive\n10 - Goonies Theme #5\n\nThat's the tracklist for just the first 5 minutes!\n\nThere are a lot of times when the soundtrack\nrepeats itself, and I am putting separate\ntracks between the music, and the dialog.\n\nThis project should be completed in late\nSeptember 2005, email me for details as\nI am a busy college student, and doing this\nin my part time.\n\nThanks everyone\n\nDominick\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0871697a61656966486f65696164266b6765&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4576b4c9f3d28c97b305f279ca2cf232eec9a54f","amp;dn":"Goonies+Sampler.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4576b4c9f3d28c97b305f279ca2cf232eec9a54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,118,180,201,243,210,140,151,179,5,242,121,202,44,242,50,238,201,165,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
