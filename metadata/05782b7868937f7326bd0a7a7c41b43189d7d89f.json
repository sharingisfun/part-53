I shall then contact your local Zoo and ask them to bring a monkey to assist you.\nYou could copy the pg2.conf -file to your install-folder, it will import the settings i am using.\n\nI'am using WinME right now cos i lost my harddrive (in the subway, lol), otherways i would use WinXP SP2.\nI only got an old 3 GB(!) harddrive at the moment.\n\nI hope this has helped you.\n\nEDIT:\nI autostart PG through the registry:\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun]\n&quot;ScanRegistry&quot;=&quot;C:\\WINDOWS\\scanregw.exe /autorun&quot;\n&quot;SystemTray&quot;=&quot;SysTray.Exe&quot;\n&quot;AVGCtrl&quot;=&quot;C:\\PROGRAM FILES\\AVPERSONAL\\AVGCTRL.EXE /min&quot;\n&quot;PeerGuardian2&quot;=&quot;C:\\PROGRAM FILES\\PeerGuardian2\\pg2.exe&quot;                                                                                                                  &lt;-- *HERE*\n&quot;TotalCommander&quot;=&quot;C:\\PROGRAM FILES\\totalcmd\\Totalcmd.exe&quot;\n&quot;DU Meter&quot;=&quot;C:\\PROGRAM FILES\\DU METER\\DUMETER.EXE&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05782b7868937f7326bd0a7a7c41b43189d7d89f","amp;dn":"PeerGuardian2beta5%2C+Win9x%2FME+ONLY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05782b7868937f7326bd0a7a7c41b43189d7d89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,120,43,120,104,147,127,115,38,189,10,122,124,65,180,49,137,215,216,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
