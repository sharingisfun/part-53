Comparable to Gwar but\nexhibiting a goofy personality of its own, the former &quot;video only&quot; outfit takes\nitself about as seriously as Spinal Tap on its first audio release. There&amp;#039;s\nnothing even remotely serious about this album -- from start to finish, this is\nobviously a parody of heavy and thrash metal and alternative rock. A few of the\nsongs sink under the weight of Jelly&amp;#039;s self-indulgence, but at its best, the\nband can be wildly entertaining. Cereal&amp;#039;s standout track is the nutty metal/rap\nhit &quot;Three Little Pigs,&quot; and almost as much fun are &quot;Electric Harley House (Of\nLove)&quot; (Jelly&amp;#039;s parody of Motorhead), &quot;Obey the Cowgod,&quot; and a cover of the Sex\nPistols&amp;#039; &quot;Anarchy In the U.K.&quot;\n\nPointless Technical Details:\nRipped on Linux with cdparanoia III 9.8, encoded with standard FLAC 1.1.0 at\nfull compression.\n\nAdditional Notes:\nThe CD this was ripped from uses &quot;Green Jello&quot; rather than &quot;Green Jelly&quot;,\ni.e. it was before they were forced to change (see review above). I&amp;#039;m not sure\nhow much, if at all, the tracks themselves changed with the name change.\nThe JPEG cover art says &quot;Jelly&quot; because it&amp;#039;s all that I could find.\n\nTrack Listing:\n 1. Obey The Cowgod\n 2. Three Little Pigs\n 3. Cereal Killer (edit)\n 4. Rock-N-Roll Pumpkihn\n 5. Anarchy In The U.K.\n 6. Electric Harley House (Of Love)\n 7. Trippin&amp;#039; On XTC\n 8. Misadventures Of Shitman\n 9. House Me Teenage Rave\n10. Flight Of The Skajaquada\n11.
