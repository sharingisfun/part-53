Just think of Christina Ricci in Sleepy Hollow, with her doll-like porcelain beauty and her good heart, and compare that role with the one she's got in 'Monster'. While you may not agree with me that Ricci plays the monster here, but rather Theron, as people sometimes mindlessly take for granted, or even the ferris-wheel spoken of in the film, you may at least agree that Theron's character isn't the only one guilty of all evil presented here. Certainly, traits belonging to the society we all share and are responsible for also intervene.\n\nPAL\nSpoken language: English\nSubs (optional): Svenska\ndts 5-channel sound\nDolby Digital stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cef14244c81aa546fd7585e66778b0eee1bdfba","amp;dn":"Monster+%28PAL%29+dts+%5Bsvensktextad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cef14244c81aa546fd7585e66778b0eee1bdfba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,239,20,36,76,129,170,84,111,215,88,94,102,119,139,14,238,27,223,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
