(he has ALS) is telling the story, guided by animations and pictures. Topics strech from the Big Bang to super-string theorys and also a lot about the history of physics.\n\nMade by Crunch Media sometime in the 90's. Think it was made for W95 of W98, but runs fine on XP as well.\n\nFor reading enthusiasts, the book has been published on the web: \n\nhttp://newton.physics.metu.edu.tr/~fizikt/html/hawking/A_Brief_History_in_Time.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a32060d21a13f49f434b35237120b3a076037e","amp;dn":"Stewen+Hawking%3A+A+brief+history+of+time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a32060d21a13f49f434b35237120b3a076037e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,163,32,96,210,26,19,244,159,67,75,53,35,113,32,179,160,118,3,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
