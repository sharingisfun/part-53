There's been put a lot more work in both editing and recording. \n\nThere's lots more shifting and harder fights in it then in the first one, also it's a bit faster paced and shorter since I prefer quality over quantity. \n\nI'm not sure if there's going to be a third one, I put a lot of work in this one and I'm a bit tired of instanced pvp, if there's going to be a next one it won't appear in the near feature. \n\nAs for now, enjoy the ride :) (btw no comment on the last song please :p). \n\nP.S. Most of the fights were taped before I hit GM, the mace only gives +1% crit and +30 stam compared to fist of omokk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a6cab9a0fe92e1f15d74120888bb07559e588d","amp;dn":"Ferocious+2+-+GM+Feral+Druid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a6cab9a0fe92e1f15d74120888bb07559e588d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,166,202,185,160,254,146,225,241,93,116,18,8,136,187,7,85,158,88,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
