Take advantage of workflow improvements in an intuitive design environment to develop construction documents that clearly represent design intent. Improve efficiencies via an object-based model that enables co-ordination with your extended design team, from conceptual design through construction documentation.\n\n\nFeatures Include:\n\nImproved connectivity between objects and enhanced modify tools streamline the design process. Easily modify system layouts while maintaining the system integrity as you stretch, move, and change the elevation of objects. Quickly make design changes, including the size and shape of objects, directly from the Properties palette, which now provides complete access to engineering data. \nThis release introduces system connectivity through external reference files (xrefs). Easily lay out, resize and modify complex or multi-storey designs that span numerous drawings. The software now notifies you when objects in referenced files have changed. And for quick onscreen feedback, take advantage of improved tooltips that now provide the ability to view object properties through an xref. \nEasy access to engineering data in your system model enables data sharing for automated sizing calculations, enhanced scheduling, and improved annotation. Extract engineering data from your models in standard file formats, like gbXML (green building extensible markup language) and ddxml (duct design extensible markup language). Take advantage of the application programming interface (API) for interoperability with third-party analysis, cost estimating, and fabrication applications, minimising manual transfer of design data and helping to ensure the accuracy of your designs. \nNow including more content, Autodesk Building Systems can be used on a wider range of projects. Building Systems 2006 introduces standards-based pipe classes and support for ANSI/ASME and ASTM/ANSI standards. The software includes new pipe-related equipment, such as more valves, clarifiers, heat exchangers, pumps, and a variety of customer requests for HVAC and electrical content such as silencers and access doors. Content is available in imperial, US metric and UK metric units. \nAn enhanced workspace moves tooltips, dimension input, and command information from the command line to the graphical interface, so you can focus on your design. By eliminating dialogue boxes, direct manipulation of objects enhances design productivity. With additional objects grips, you can add new objects from connectors on existing objects and quickly place fittings on-the-fly. As you work, dynamic dimensions help ensure that design changes are precise and accurate. \nAvoid duplication of work and move smoothly from preliminary design to design development by taking advantage of duct design improvements. Increase productivity with improved connectivity between objects that makes system layout even easier, and convert one-line designs to sized 3D through intuitive onscreen modifications. \nUse display themes to graphically analyse and present your design intent with this release's ability to use nongraphic data, such as a room's heating or cooling load requirements, or calculated date, such as velocity in duct or pipe runs, to create colour-filled thematic displays, complete with legends. \nEliminate the need to manually add construction annotation by taking advantage of haloed line display to accurately represent plan views of objects that cross at different elevations. This release supports haloed line display for pipes and conduits and masks duct hatching on underlying ducts, making it easier to interpret designs. \nWith the click of a button, publish your designs as Autodesk DWF (Design Web Format) files for easy viewing in Autodesk DWF Composer or the free Autodesk DWF Viewer. This release supports the creation of 3D DWF files, complete with engineering data, for better communication of design intent. And with DWF file format, team members can review and redline as well, making the DWF format an efficient means to distribute and share data. \nMore flexible setup and deployment options provide consistent standardisation and management of software installations for both network and single-user installations. Through the use of profile-based shortcuts, a license can now automatically default to specified template drawings when the software is launched. New project standards help maintain consistency across an Autodesk Building Systems 2006 project, project tool palettes ensure that all team members have the tools they need, and workspaces enable you to save user-interface settings as a specific &quot;theme,&quot; making it easy to switch between common properties. \nGet better overall performance with Autodesk Building Systems 2006 software. Manage your projects with tools that are now smoothly integrated with the AutoCAD Sheet Set Manager, increasing the speed of drawing co-ordination. And access parts through the Add and Modify dialogue boxes faster from the streamlined, comprehensive parts catalogues. \n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nWindows\n\nIntel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz or faster or AMD-K7 3.4 GHZ or faster \n2 GB RAM \n\nMicrosoft Windows XP Professional (SP2 or later), XP Home Edition (SP2 or later), XP Tablet PC Edition (SP2 or later), or Windows 2000 Professional (SP4 or later) operating system \n\n1024x768 VGA with true colour video display \n\nWindows video display driver with 64 MB RAM \n\n2 GB free disk space for full install \n\nPointing device (mouse or digitiser with Wintab driver) \n\nSerial port (for digitisers and some plotters) \n\nPrinter or plotter \n\n\nI seed to 20.12.2005 and start 03.01.2006 \nI've got a loow upload 10 kB/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c66fa3dcb146fa3fc739c649790adb7f5e63ed","amp;dn":"Autodesk+Building+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c66fa3dcb146fa3fc739c649790adb7f5e63ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,198,111,163,220,177,70,250,63,199,57,198,73,121,10,219,127,94,99,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
