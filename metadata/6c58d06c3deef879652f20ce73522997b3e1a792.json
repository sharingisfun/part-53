Also, the NorthAmerican release of the game added 9 tracks not present on the LEsoundtrack, and even that soundtrack didn&amp;#039;t loop the music in mostcases, stopping after a single play, which is particularly unsatisfyingon many of the game&amp;#039;s driving battle pieces.&quot;\n\n- Enjoy -\n(ricowanker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c58d06c3deef879652f20ce73522997b3e1a792","amp;dn":"Disgaea+unofficial+OST+%283CDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c58d06c3deef879652f20ce73522997b3e1a792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,88,208,108,61,238,248,121,101,47,32,206,115,82,41,151,179,225,167,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
