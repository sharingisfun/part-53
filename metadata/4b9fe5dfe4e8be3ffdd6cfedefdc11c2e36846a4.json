This is a highly competent album of rock music with some excellent fuzz guitar and psychedelic touches. Of particular note is the awesome &quot;You should Be More Careful&quot; which ranks as one of the greatest US psych guitar mind warpers ever made ! \n\nsize:        83.6 mb\nbitrate:     320\n\n\t\nPersonnel:\nSTEVE BRUNO \torgan, bs \tA\nJIM DAHME \tgtr, flte, vcls \tA\nBOB PATTERSON \tgtr, vcls \tA\nHANK RANSOME \tdrms \tA\nSTEVE WEINGART \tld gtr, harp, organ, vcls \tA\n \n\nALBUM:\n1.ELIZABETH \t(Vanguard VSD 6501) \t1968\n\nNB: (1) reissued on vinyl and CD by Vanguard/Comet in Italy, 2000 as part of the labels 50 year celebration.

Originally from Philadelphia they moved to New York, where they recorded their album. Earlier, drummer Stewkie Antoni, who later played with The Nazz, had played with them and Hank Ransome later played for Good God and Duke Williams and The Extremes.\n\nCompilation appearances include: Not That Kind Of Guy on The New Sound Of Underground (LP).\n\nTrack title\n1.
