Catch-22 is a satire illustrating how some opportunists successfully exploit the war for there own ends while others are dying fighting it.\n\nCatch-22 has become an expression to describe the opposite to common sense.  A Kafka like situation when bureaucrats interpret the law with an insane logic, destroying the little man the law was intended to protect (in a democracy anyway).\n\nQuote:\n\nIn the mess: \n-Those bastards are trying to kill me.\n-No one is trying to kill you sweetheart. Eat your desert like a good boy.\n-Then why are they shooting at me Milo?\n-They are shooting at everyone Yossarian.\n-What difference will that make?\n-Yossarian, just suppose everyone thought the way you do.\n-I&amp;#039;d be a damn fool to think any different.\n-You need your head examined.\n\nOn the airstrip:\n-Anyone who wants to get out of combat isn&amp;#039;t really crazy,\n-so I can&amp;#039;t ground him.\n-OK.
