They were only around for 3 years, and this was shot during their last year. I don't know the song titles... hoping that some of you punk archaeologists can help with that. Not even sure where it was shot. I think it was Philadelphia, but I really don't know. I got this in a video tape trade 20 years ago and all I have on the tape is &amp;quot;Void Live.&amp;quot; \n\nPlease don't sell! Trade only! Play nice!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936413dbadc710d9ea85d26538848a032fdff00c","amp;dn":"VOID+Live+Video+1983+Color+SVCD+Punk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936413dbadc710d9ea85d26538848a032fdff00c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,100,19,219,173,199,16,217,234,133,210,101,56,132,138,3,47,223,240,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
