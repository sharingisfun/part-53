Their songs are about sex and beer and the usual, but presented in a humorous and catchey souding way.\n\nThe files are in .m4a format. I think they were ripped with iTunes, but I can't remember.\n\nAnyway, if you haven't heard of 'em, check them out. I hope you enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c3651d276183de8f871dc6b357a01607c2f910","amp;dn":"Bickley+-+Kiss+The+Bunny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c3651d276183de8f871dc6b357a01607c2f910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,195,101,29,39,97,131,222,143,135,29,198,179,87,160,22,7,194,249,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
