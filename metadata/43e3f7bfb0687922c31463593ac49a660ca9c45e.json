(10/2000)\n[by Arguru and waKa x] \n\nand Saiko 1.0 (release 9) (12/2000)\n\n\nI decided to dig these up from my CD-ROM archives.  These are hard to find.  They were released as freeware and they were never continued after the end of 2000.  Arguru&amp;#039;s website is also down.\n\nSaiko is techno improv fun, with little effort.  With release 7, you can save your live jams directly to a .wav file if you&amp;#039;d like.  The sound is a bit tinny overall, or not enough bass and too much treble.  Release 9 has a more balanced sound and has better overdrive &amp; harmonic effects, in my opinion, but the save function is disabled. :-(\n\nGive these a try.  It&amp;#039;s a very small file-- please keep this on your hard drive and reseed it everywhere.  Keep it live and alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43e3f7bfb0687922c31463593ac49a660ca9c45e","amp;dn":"Saiko%2C+versions+1.07+%26+1.09%2C+Algorithmic+electronica+composer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43e3f7bfb0687922c31463593ac49a660ca9c45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,227,247,191,176,104,121,34,195,20,99,89,58,196,154,102,12,169,196,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
