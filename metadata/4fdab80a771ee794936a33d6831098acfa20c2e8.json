This game uses DMA(Dynamic memory)which means the adresses dont stay the same..more or less..\n\n*Last but definately not least, all apologies to those who downloaded prince of persia the two thrones +2 trainer version 1 and +4 trainer version 2,I will say it again I was a noob and just because my first trainers worked a few times I assumed they were allgood to go and unleashed them on you (the public)..Well I hope this Version will make up for it, and Iook forward to making more now that I know what im doing..\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fdab80a771ee794936a33d6831098acfa20c2e8","amp;dn":"Prince+Of+Persia+%2B4+Trainer%28FIXED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fdab80a771ee794936a33d6831098acfa20c2e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,218,184,10,119,30,231,148,147,106,51,214,131,16,152,172,250,32,194,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
