Wells, adapted by Howard Koch. Leonard Nimoy, Gates McFadden, Brent Spiner and fellow cast members from the TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot; recreate this classic science fiction thriller, which became known as the &quot;panic broadcast&quot; when it first aired in 1938. The story?s breathless pace and convincing details make it clear why so many believed that the aliens were among us. Rounding out this broadcast of Old Time Radio Drama is a hilarious reprisal of &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, the CBS radio series that inspired &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr. Marilu Henner stars as Liz Cooper, the Lucille Ball character. Jeff Conaway, Harold Gould and Alley Mills also star.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f35080715862bbf44f02324e63066b89d9ac6ab4","amp;dn":"War+Of+The+Worlds+-+Star+Trek+Cast+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f35080715862bbf44f02324e63066b89d9ac6ab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,80,128,113,88,98,187,244,79,2,50,78,99,6,107,137,217,172,106,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
