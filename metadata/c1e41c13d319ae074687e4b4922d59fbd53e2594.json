Sir Alec Guiness's eight different turns have been much commented on and deserve every superlative they've received. Dennis Price is too little recognized--in the US, at least--for his gifts, as his work here proves. Valerie Hobson is wonderful, and Joyce Greenwood is...I would happily buy a recording of her reading the OED, just to hear that astonishing voice. And, in a small but marvelous role, Miles Malleson is superb. If you have not seen this film, it's readily available. Give yourself a treat. I know that Hollywood seems to have forgotten that there's nothing to be gained by trying to remake a perfect film. If they ever dare to do it with this one--I don't give a damn who is in it, or who directs or writes--don't bother. See the original. None genuine without the Ealing Label.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e41c13d319ae074687e4b4922d59fbd53e2594","amp;dn":"Kind+Hearts+And+Coronets+-+Alec+Guinness+1949","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e41c13d319ae074687e4b4922d59fbd53e2594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,228,28,19,211,25,174,7,70,135,228,180,146,45,89,251,213,62,37,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
