Abundant footage taken among the massive crowd ('half a million strong') expresses the human heart of the event, from skinny-dipping hippies to accidental overdoses, to unpredictable weather, midconcert childbirth, and the thoughtful (or just plain rambling) reflections of the festive participants. Then, of course, there is the music--a nonstop parade of rock &amp; roll from the greatest performers of the period, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Canned Heat, The Who, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Ten Years After, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Santana, and many more. Watching this ambitious film, as the saying goes, is the next best thing to being there--it's a time-travel journey to that once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\nSlit den med hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤lsan...\nBeria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb2ab8430af8f176bd88cd1e9cc2f197cc4a034","amp;dn":"Woodstock+-+PAL+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb2ab8430af8f176bd88cd1e9cc2f197cc4a034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,178,171,132,48,175,143,23,107,216,140,209,233,204,47,25,124,196,160,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
