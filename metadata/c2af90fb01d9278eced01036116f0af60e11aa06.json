It tries to answer some question, some of which: Is any of them still valid or not? Did science come with or against what they metioned hundreds of years ago as (words of The Lord)? Does religion as a whole contradict with science or not?\n\nIt is realy a very smart book that deserves reading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2af90fb01d9278eced01036116f0af60e11aa06","amp;dn":"The+Bible%2CThe+Qur%5C%27an+%26+Science+%28By+Maurice+Bucaille%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2af90fb01d9278eced01036116f0af60e11aa06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,175,144,251,1,217,39,142,206,208,16,54,17,111,10,246,14,17,170,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
