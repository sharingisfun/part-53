It consisted of the combination of more or less normal popsongs with an approach that belongs to the world of musique concrÃƒÂ¨te, John Cage and avant-garde electronics.\n\nA few years later this type of music would be called  ?house? and, in retrospect, one wonders how its reception would have been had this recording been released in, say,  1985. Although some music-magazines were enthousistic about it, an album that consisted of purely synths &amp; percussion was clearly too much ahead of its time. A Dutch pop-encyclopaedia even wrote it off as ?toy-music? (indeed some childrens-toys are used in ?Blue Jeans?) and no promotion-singles of the album were released. However, despite an (official) sale of a mere 150 copies, ?Has It Ever Started? did have a growing influence on many musicians both of the eighties and afterwards, and over the years has gained the status of a hard-sought but rarely found collectors-item.\n\nBart Terlaak (drums) in 1982 already was a Dutch pop-icon, having played with bands like The Jumping Jewels, Island and Carlsberg. After The TWO he again picked up his commercial career with The Little Giants (De Gigantjes).\n \nHero Wouters (synths) was a composer of music for film and theatre and the owner of a small recording-studio in Amsterdam. Although he preferred to work as a solo-artist his other groups include Dada di Musica, Angelos Obscuros (with Legendary Pink Dots-singer Edward Ka-Spel), Panta Rhei and Nul Kelvin. \n\nSide 1:\n01.
