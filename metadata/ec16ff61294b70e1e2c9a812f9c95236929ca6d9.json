The drama recounts the years of his life from the late 1920s through the 1940s, an epoch when Hughes was directing movies and test flying innovative aircraft he designed and created. It also chronicles Hughes&amp;#039; struggle with his physical disabilities and phobias, and his increasingly erratic, obsessive-compulsive behavior that led him ultimately to isolate himself from his associates and withdraw from the world.\n\nYear\t\t \t2004\nGenre\t\t\tDrama\nRating\t\t\t14A\nParental Guide\t\t\tNot recommended for young children, offensive language, nudity\nLength\t\t\t2:45\nDirected by\t\t\tMartin Scorsese\nWritten by\t\t\tJohn Logan\nCompany\t\t\tMiramax\nStarring\t\t\tLeonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Gwen Stefani, Adam Scott, Kelli Garner, Ian Holm, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Emma Campbell, Frances Conroy, Willem Dafoe, StÃƒÂ©phane Demers, Stanley DeSantis\n\t\t\nResolution: 576*248","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec16ff61294b70e1e2c9a812f9c95236929ca6d9","amp;dn":"The+Aviator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec16ff61294b70e1e2c9a812f9c95236929ca6d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,22,255,97,41,75,112,225,226,201,168,18,249,201,82,54,146,156,166,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
