The answer is soon discovered in the ancient language of the Navajo. Enlisted into the Marine Corps are several &quot;Windtalkers&quot; who are deployed to frontline areas in the Pacific, to use their language as an impossible-to-crack secret code. A drawback, however, is that the U.S. military soon puts forth a directive that the Windtalkers must never be captured alive by the enemy, so additional Marines are assigned to make certian that this directive is carried out to the letter.\n\nSummary written by Anthony Hughes {husnock31 at hotmail}\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nQuality:\nVideo:       xVid ~ 1238 kbps\nAudio:       MP3  ~ 256 kbps\nFPS:         25.0 FPS\nResolution:  640x264 (2.42:1)\nSize:        cd 1 - 717,308 KB 01:05:16\n             cd 2 - 697,032 KB 01:03:26\nOverall:     Pretty High quality\nLanguage:    English\nSubs:        English, Dansk, Espa&amp;ntilde;ol, Deutsch, Greek, Finska, Norsk, Svenska, &amp; Portugu&amp;ecirc;s\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOnly problem I found is simple.  The sound didn't play when I started the first file and so I seeked ahead a couple seconds and everything was fine!
